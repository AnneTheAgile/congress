05:27:05,893 --> 05:26:23,753
AND
5314
05:27:06,394 --> 05:26:24,154
BILLIONAIRES.
5315
05:27:07,161 --> 05:26:24,821
SOME WOULD SUGGEST THOSE ARE
5316
05:27:07,495 --> 05:26:26,256
THE
5317
05:27:07,828 --> 05:26:26,923

05:27:09,096 --> 05:26:27,323
CREATORS.
5319
05:27:09,797 --> 05:26:27,924
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WE
5320
05:27:11,232 --> 05:26:30,627
REALIZED
5321
05:27:13,000 --> 05:26:31,060
8.2 MILLION JOBS LOST.
5322
05:27:13,400 --> 05:26:32,628
SO THAT
5323
05:27:14,134 --> 05:26:33,029
DIDN'T WORK.
5324
05:27:14,435 --> 05:26:34,630
WE
5325
05:27:16,937 --> 05:26:34,997
OUGHT NOT GO BACK AN REVISIT
5326
05:27:17,671 --> 05:26:36,866
THAT FORMULA BECAUSE IT WAS
5327
05:27:18,038 --> 05:26:37,233
NOT
5328
05:27:18,338 --> 05:26:39,668
A
5329
05:27:19,873 --> 05:26:40,336
FORMULA FOR SUCCESS.
5330
05:27:20,440 --> 05:26:40,836
WHAT WE NEED HERE
5331
05:27:22,008 --> 05:26:41,237
IS TO BRING
5332
05:27:22,442 --> 05:26:42,605

05:27:39,125 --> 05:27:01,723
DISCUSSION.
5352
05:27:39,525 --> 05:27:03,825
BECAUSE

5949
05:36:41,336 --> 05:36:06,003
AND
5950
05:36:42,905 --> 05:36:07,972
THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT BILL
5951
05:36:43,207 --> 05:36:08,339
IS
5952
05:36:44,940 --> 05:36:08,706

WORK, IT
5962
05:36:54,482 --> 05:36:16,447

5964
05:36:56,317 --> 05:36:18,248
OUR ECONOMY
5965
05:36:58,853 --> 05:36:18,515
AND IF WE DO IT
5966
05:36:59,287 --> 05:36:20,517

5967
05:37:01,289 --> 05:36:21,151

05:37:03,657 --> 05:36:22,752
THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE,
5971
05:37:04,091 --> 05:36:23,219
THEN WE
5972
05:37:04,492 --> 05:36:23,920
PUT EVEN
5973
05:37:06,026 --> 05:36:25,555
MORE PEOPLE TO WORK
5974
05:37:06,493 --> 05:36:26,289
WHILE WE'RE

05:37:09,096 --> 05:36:27,056

05:37:10,364 --> 05:36:29,058
SO, YES, STOP AMERICAN JOBS FROM

05:37:11,064 --> 05:36:30,693
GOING DOWN THE DRAIN ACT.
5979
05:37:13,634 --> 05:36:31,193

OF THE MAKE IT IN AMERICA
5991
05:37:21,674 --> 05:36:41,003
AGENDA.
5992
05:37:22,408 --> 05:36:41,336
USING OUR TAX MONEY, IN THIS
5993
05:37:23,843 --> 05:36:42,905

6002
05:37:31,617 --> 05:36:52,580
I HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD DO THE

05:37:32,852 --> 05:36:53,481

AGENDA.
6016
05:37:45,363 --> 05:37:06,026

6627
05:47:54,971 --> 05:47:11,497
ALMOST
6628
05:47:57,640 --> 05:47:11,997
14 MONTHS, TO FIGURE OUT
6629
05:47:58,041 --> 05:47:16,435
A BETTER
6630
05:47:59,542 --> 05:47:16,602

6632
05:48:01,544 --> 05:47:17,936

6633
05:48:01,944 --> 05:47:19,805
A LITTLE
6634
05:48:02,979 --> 05:47:20,138
DIFFERENT CUTS THAT
6635
05:48:03,312 --> 05:47:21,406

05:48:03,679 --> 05:47:21,940

05:48:06,949 --> 05:47:23,108

05:48:10,719 --> 05:47:26,478
DISCRETIONARY

THAT.
6646
05:48:14,256 --> 05:47:30,415
SO IT'S
6647
05:48:15,924 --> 05:47:30,949
NOT ALL ROST.
6648
05:48:16,391 --> 05:47:32,617

AGRICULTURE.
6893
05:52:26,828 --> 05:51:43,520
THE FOCUS WAS TOTALLY ON THE

STILL THE GREATEST

WE'VE HAD OUR

05:53:01,661 --> 05:52:16,618
DIFFICULTIES IN THE PAST, THERE
6928
05:53:02,094 --> 05:52:16,918
HAVE BEEN
6929
05:53:04,697 --> 05:52:19,688

BOOKS,
6939
05:53:18,543 --> 05:52:30,064
WE HAD SOME
6940
05:53:19,044 --> 05:52:30,932
MOMENTS.
6941
05:53:19,377 --> 05:52:31,365
THE
6942
05:53:21,880 --> 05:52:31,999
REASON WE ARE IN TROUBLED
6943
05:53:22,480 --> 05:52:33,100
WATERS, THAT PEOPLE
6944
05:53:23,148 --> 05:52:33,901
CAN'T SEEM
6945
05:53:23,448 --> 05:52:34,435
TO
6946
05:53:24,949 --> 05:52:34,869
COMPREHEND, WE NEVER HAD A

EWE
6948
05:53:26,050 --> 05:52:41,642
ROE.
6949
05:53:26,651 --> 05:52:42,176
WE NEVER HAD EUROPE
6950
05:53:27,085 --> 05:52:43,010
IN THE
6951
05:53:27,518 --> 05:52:43,443
STATE THAT
6952
05:53:28,886 --> 05:52:43,644
IT IS PRESENTLY IN.
6953
05:53:29,287 --> 05:52:44,978
WHEN THE
6954
05:53:30,855 --> 05:52:45,412
MARKETS WERE TROUBLED
6955
05:53:31,288 --> 05:52:45,779
ON MONDAY,
6956
05:53:34,025 --> 05:52:46,913
WAS IT MONDAY?
6957
05:53:34,358 --> 05:52:47,481
EVEN
6958
05:53:37,061 --> 05:52:47,814
POST, I THINK MONDAY THEY
6959
05:53:37,828 --> 05:52:49,382
PERCOLATED BUT WHEN THEY WERE
6960
05:53:38,429 --> 05:52:49,849
TROUBLED,
6961
05:53:40,397 --> 05:52:50,317
THEY WERE LOOKING AT
6962
05:53:40,798 --> 05:52:51,918
EUROPE.
6963
05:53:41,198 --> 05:52:52,318
SO IF WE
6964
05:53:42,366 --> 05:52:54,654
GET OBSESSED WITH
6965
05:53:42,733 --> 05:52:55,154
OTHER
6966
05:53:43,167 --> 05:52:56,055

ABOUT HOW

05:53:46,203 --> 05:53:00,860
WE CAN GET BACK IN
6970
05:53:46,603 --> 05:53:01,661
THE GAME
6971
05:53:49,039 --> 05:53:02,094
AT THE PEAK WE WANT TO
6972
05:53:49,506 --> 05:53:04,697
BE, WE DON'T
6973
05:53:52,275 --> 05:53:05,097
TAKE IN THE GREAT
6974
05:53:52,675 --> 05:53:07,800
PICTURE.
6975
05:53:53,376 --> 05:53:08,133
THAT GREAT PICTURE IS OUR
6976
05:53:53,910 --> 05:53:14,840
MARKETS ARE NOT
6977
05:53:56,112 --> 05:53:15,540
NECESSARILY
6978
05:53:56,713 --> 05:53:16,308
TROUBLED, WE NEED TO
6979
05:53:57,313 --> 05:53:16,675
DO BETTER,
6980
05:53:57,613 --> 05:53:17,109
WE
6981
05:53:59,315 --> 05:53:18,076
NEED TO CREATE JOBS, BUT
6982
05:53:59,715 --> 05:53:18,543
THEY ARE
6983
05:54:00,650 --> 05:53:19,044
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
6984
05:54:01,350 --> 05:53:19,377
AND THEY ARE TROUBLED BY
6985
05:54:02,251 --> 05:53:21,880
THE
6986
05:54:02,652 --> 05:53:22,480
EWE ROE.
6987
05:54:03,486 --> 05:53:23,148
WHAT I WAS
6988
05:54:04,520 --> 05:53:23,448
SAYING, LET'S
6989
05:54:05,287 --> 05:53:24,949
UNDERSTAND THAT SO WE CAN DO
6990
05:54:06,922 --> 05:53:25,283

05:54:34,448 --> 05:53:56,713

05:54:36,050 --> 05:53:57,313
NOW IN THE AMERICAN

THE FIGHT WE

MR. TONKO:
8198
06:15:20,689 --> 06:14:27,606
YOU HIGHLIGHT SOME OF
8199
06:15:21,123 --> 06:14:31,042
THE MAJOR

06:15:22,524 --> 06:14:31,643
DIFFERENCES AND
8201
06:15:23,192 --> 06:14:33,545
DISAGREEMENTS THAT HAVE

06:15:24,626 --> 06:14:34,078
HIGHLIGHTED THE DEBATE

THE TWO

SUGGEST IT'S

06:15:30,265 --> 06:14:46,357
PROBABLY SOME OF

06:15:30,599 --> 06:14:47,625
THE

06:15:33,301 --> 06:14:50,260
REASONS THAT THE

06:15:36,673 --> 06:14:50,828
COME TO
8215
06:15:37,238 --> 06:14:51,161
CONSENSUS, BECAUSE
8216
06:15:38,473 --> 06:14:51,662
WE HAVE
8217
06:15:39,006 --> 06:14:52,062
CALLED UPON AN

IS
8220
06:15:41,075 --> 06:14:56,333
FAIR, BALANCED
8221
06:15:42,610 --> 06:14:56,867
AND BOLD, THAT WE
8222
06:15:43,010 --> 06:14:57,401
WILL NOT

06:15:43,310 --> 06:14:57,801

06:15:51,185 --> 06:15:06,843
MILLIONAIRES
8230
06:15:51,385 --> 06:15:07,610
AND
8231
06:15:52,452 --> 06:15:08,411
BILLIONAIRES TO

06:15:52,953 --> 06:15:09,045
BE PAID FOR BY
8233
06:15:54,855 --> 06:15:09,414
CUTS TO MEDICARE.
8234
06:15:55,288 --> 06:15:11,847
THERE WERE
8235
06:15:57,624 --> 06:15:12,348
THOSE WHO FOUGHT
8236
06:15:58,291 --> 06:15:14,450
SOCIAL SECURITY AT ITS
8237
06:15:59,092 --> 06:15:15,251
INCEPTION
8238
06:15:59,593 --> 06:15:16,819
AND FOUGHT IT
8239
06:16:01,661 --> 06:15:17,853
FOR 76 YEARS AND
8240
06:16:02,162 --> 06:15:18,287
WANT TO DENY
8241
06:16:02,996 --> 06:15:20,689
IT.
8242
06:16:03,396 --> 06:15:21,123
AND IT'S
8243
06:16:06,032 --> 06:15:22,524
ABOUT MAKING CERTAIN
8244
06:16:06,366 --> 06:15:23,192
THAT
8245
06:16:09,669 --> 06:15:24,626
THERE'S AN UNDERPINNING OF
8246
06:16:10,136 --> 06:15:24,893
SUPPORT FOR
8247
06:16:10,403 --> 06:15:25,661
OUR

06:16:11,737 --> 06:15:26,194
ELDERLY AS THEY
8249
06:16:12,171 --> 06:15:26,661
GROW INTO
8250
06:16:14,440 --> 06:15:27,062
WHAT IS A LONGER LIFE
8251
06:16:14,807 --> 06:15:28,263
SPAN.
8252
06:16:16,375 --> 06:15:28,730
WE HAVE TO HAVE MEASURES IN
8253
06:16:17,343 --> 06:15:30,265
PLACE THAT
8254
06:16:17,676 --> 06:15:30,599
ENABLE
8255
06:16:19,712 --> 06:15:33,301
THERE TO BE A
8256
06:16:20,245 --> 06:15:33,968
QUALITY OF LIFE
8257
06:16:22,047 --> 06:15:36,673
THAT PROVIDES
8258
06:16:22,447 --> 06:15:37,238
ECONOMIC
8259
06:16:26,485 --> 06:15:38,473
VITALITY, ECONOMIC
8260
06:16:26,952 --> 06:15:39,006
BALANCE FOR
8261
06:16:28,854 --> 06:15:39,374
THOSE WHO MOVE INTO

06:16:29,387 --> 06:15:39,574
THEIR RETIREMENT
8263
06:16:30,488 --> 06:15:41,075
YEARS.
8264
06:16:31,022 --> 06:15:42,610
AND I THINK THAT
8265
06:16:32,891 --> 06:15:43,010
WHEN WE LOOK AT
8266
06:16:33,224 --> 06:15:43,310
THE

06:18:14,253 --> 06:17:37,018
TO BE PART
8360
06:18:14,820 --> 06:17:37,452
OF A TRADITION OF
8361
06:18:15,087 --> 06:17:38,186
THE
8362
06:18:16,822 --> 06:17:38,920
DEMOCRATIC PARTY
8363
06:18:19,458 --> 06:17:40,488

8364
06:18:19,892 --> 06:17:41,255
FOUGHT FOR
8365
06:18:20,692 --> 06:17:41,656
SOCIAL SECURITY AND
8366
06:18:21,026 --> 06:17:42,156

8370
06:18:23,495 --> 06:17:46,026
FOR ALL.
8371
06:18:23,895 --> 06:17:46,327

BETTER COUNTRY AS A RESULT.
8376
06:18:28,867 --> 06:17:51,231
SO I THINK IT'S
8377
06:18:30,301 --> 06:17:51,632
FAIR TO SAY
8378
06:18:30,835 --> 06:17:54,067

8386
06:18:37,341 --> 06:18:00,407
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM
8387
06:18:39,010 --> 06:18:02,242

06:18:47,184 --> 06:18:07,513

8396
06:18:48,052 --> 06:18:08,181
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT

06:18:48,652 --> 06:18:09,415
LIVING IN

06:18:49,353 --> 06:18:09,782
REALITY MOST OF THE TIME.
8399
06:18:50,754 --> 06:18:11,484
