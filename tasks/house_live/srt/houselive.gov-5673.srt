THERE IS
407
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:02,702
CURRENTLY A PROPOSAL

00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:04,770
OTHER BODY THAT

HERE
416
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:08,708
TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND AND
417
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:09,042
EXPAND THE
418
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:12,646
PAYROLL TAX CUT AND

00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:13,079
PAY FOR

00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:15,648
IT.

UNDER THIS
422
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:17,584
PROPOSAL EMPLOYEES
423
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:18,018
WOULD RECEIVE A
424
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:20,587
50% ADDITIONAL
425
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:21,121
CUT
426
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:22,789
IN THE PAYROLL TAX, CUTTING
427
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:23,123
IT
428
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:26,561
ESSENTIALLY IN HALF, AND
429
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:26,861
EMPLOYERS
430
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:30,564
WOULD HAVE A SLIGHT
431
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:30,998
REDUCTION
432
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:32,700
IN THE PAYROLL TAX
433
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:33,133
THAT THEY
434
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:35,803
PAY ON THEIR
435
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:36,236

437
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:38,106
OF PAYROLL
438
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:42,577
-- EXCUSE ME -- $5
439
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:43,010
MILLION OF
440
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:45,746
PAYROLL.
441
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:46,180
THIS WOULD HELP
442
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:47,582
98% OF
443
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:48,116
BUSINESSES BUT
444
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:49,584
NOT GIVE
445
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:50,085
UNNECESSARY
446
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:51,586
GIVEAWAYS TO LARGE
447
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:52,053
AND
448
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:53,655
PROFITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.
449
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:53,988
AND MOST
450
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:55,857
IMPORTANT, IT WOULD
451
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:56,257
PREVENT THE
452
00:11:02,564 --> 00:10:57,693
TYPICAL FAMILY FROM
453
00:11:02,998 --> 00:10:58,160
SUFFERING
454
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:02,564
A SIGNIFICANT
455
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:02,998
INCREASE
456
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:04,900
IN THEIR TAXES WHILE
457
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:05,300
THE
458
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:06,669
ECONOMY IS STILL FRAGILE.
459
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:07,003
THIS PROPOSAL
460
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:09,739
WOULD GIVE THE
461
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:10,239
AVERAGE FAMILY
462
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:12,575
$1,500 A YEAR
463
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:13,075
EXTRA
464
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:16,580
TO SPEND.
465
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:16,947
YOU WOULD THINK
466
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:18,615
THAT PEOPLE
467
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:19,149
OUGHT
468
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:19,883
TO BE ABLE TO CORRELATE
469
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:20,250
THOSE
470
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:22,785
TWO CONCEPTS.
471
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:23,152
THE
472
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:24,754
WAY THAT THIS WOULD BE
473
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:25,087
FINANCED IS A
474
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:28,592
SMALL SURTAX ON
475
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:29,092
NOT
476
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:30,761
JUST RICH BUT SUPERRICH
477
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:31,094
PEOPLE.
478
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:33,663
THESE ARE FOLKS WHO
479
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:34,064
MAKE OVER
480
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:34,664
$1
481
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:35,832
MILLION A YEAR AND THEY
482
00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:36,132
WOULD JUST
483
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:37,768
PAY THE SURTAX ON
484
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:38,202
THAT AMOUNT THAT
485
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:40,604
THEY EARN OVER
486
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:41,137
THE
487
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:43,606
$1 MILLION THRESHOLD.
488
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:43,940
IT'S FAR LESS
489
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:45,575
THAN THE 1% THAT
490
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:46,075
WE ARE
491
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:47,711
HEARING ARGUED ABOUT.
492
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:48,078
THEY WOULD
493
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:50,714
STILL PAY LOWER BUSH
494
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:51,147
TAX-ERA
495
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:55,819
RATES ON THE FIRST $1
496
00:11:58,188 --> 00:11:56,319
MILLION AND
497
00:11:59,723 --> 00:11:57,721
THOSE THAT HAVE
498
00:12:00,157 --> 00:11:58,188
EXTENSIVE
499
00:12:01,058 --> 00:11:59,723
INVESTMENT INCOME
500
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:00,157
WHICH
501
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:01,058
MOST OF
502
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:01,425
THEM DO WOULD
503
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:01,758
STILL
504
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:03,694
BENEFIT FROM THOSE
505
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:04,061
LOWER
506
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:08,799
RATES.
507
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:08,966
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE PEOPLE
508
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:10,167
HERE THAT ARE CAUGHT UP
509
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:11,669
IN AN
510
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:12,336
IDEOLOGY THAT TRUMPS
511
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:12,837
CONCERN
512
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:14,471
FOR THE ECONOMY
513
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:15,039
AND THE
514
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:15,573
TYPICAL
515
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:15,839
AMERICAN FAMILY.
516
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:17,776
IT WAS
517
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:18,309
THIS REFUSAL TO CONSIDER
518
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:19,110
A
519
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:21,045
BALANCED APPROACH THAT IS
520
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:21,346
SUPPORTED
521
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:22,847
BY THE VAST MAJORITY
522
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:23,283
OF THE PUBLIC
523
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:25,049
THAT LED TO THE
524
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:25,550
COLLAPSE OF THE
525
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:28,854
SO-CALLED
526
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:29,388
SUPERCOMMITTEE.
527
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:30,889
AMERICANS WERE AND
528
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:31,423
ARE READY
529
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:32,524
FOR ACTION
530
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:33,858
THAT IS BOLD, BIG
531
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:34,292
AND BALANCED
532
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:37,963
AND FAIR.
533
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:38,430
NOW, WE
534
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:40,833
ACTUALLY CAN START ON
535
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:41,233
THE ROAD TO
536
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:42,868
RECOVERY BY JUST
537
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:43,335
GOING
538
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:44,904
ON AUTOPILOT.
539
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:45,270
THE
540
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:47,173
DEFAULT THAT IS SET UP THAT
541
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:47,507
WILL
542
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:49,208
LET THE BUSH-ERA TAX CUTS
543
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:49,542
EXPIRE, UNLESS
544
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:53,012
CONGRESS DONE
545
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:53,512
SOMETHING, AND MOVING
546
00:12:59,085 --> 00:12:55,014
TOWARDS
547
00:12:59,819 --> 00:12:55,648
AUTOMATIC SEQUESTRATION WILL
548
00:13:01,654 --> 00:12:59,085
ACTUALLY SOLVE
549
00:13:03,122 --> 00:12:59,819
MOST OF THE
550
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:01,654
DEFICIT PROBLEM THAT
551
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:03,122
WE FACE
552
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:03,723
JUST BY DOING
553
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:05,191
NOTHING.
554
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:05,691
BUT WE CAN
555
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:08,063
DO BETTER.
556
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:08,495
WE CAN
557
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:09,329
ADJUST, WE CAN CRAFT, WE
558
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:09,696
CAN
559
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:11,231
FOCUS IT TO GET THE MOST
560
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:11,565
BENEFIT
561
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:13,200
AND WE CAN START WITH A
562
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:13,600
MODEST
563
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:17,171
ADJUSTMENT.

I'D HOPE MY COLLEAGUES
565
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:19,073

ADDING 1% TO THE ECONOMY
2082

AND
2083
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:11,563
WILL FURTHER INCREASE
2084
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:11,896
EMPLOYMENT BY
2085
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:14,265
ONE MILLION JOBS.
2086
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:14,766
AFTER

IN THE LAST 80
2092
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:22,941
YEARS, THE REPUBLICANS
2093
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:24,376
ACTUALLY
2094
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:25,010
CRITICIZE THE

00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:26,579
RECOVERY ACT NOW
2096
00:38:28,914 --> 00:38:27,079
FOR THE FACT IT

00:38:29,782 --> 00:38:28,381
DIDN'T DO
2098
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:28,914
ENOUGH.
2099
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:29,782
THAT SPEAKS LESS TO THE MERITS
2100
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:30,182
OF THE RECOVERY
2101
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:30,950

00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:34,553
OF THE GREAT

2107
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:35,754
AND IT
2108
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:36,188
IS EXTRAORDINARY
2109
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:36,756
CHUTZPAH
2110
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:39,459
FROM THE OTHER SIDE TO

00:38:42,995 --> 00:38:39,859
JUST SAY NO
2112
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:42,528

00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:44,664
RECOVERY ACT FROM BEING
2115
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:44,997
INADEQUATE.
2116
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:46,733
THE GREAT RECESSION WAS
2117
00:38:49,603 --> 00:38:47,200

00:43:12,475 --> 00:43:11,575
MORE.
2385
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:11,975
PAKISTAN
2386
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:12,475
TIPPED OFF TERRORISTS

TWICE
2390
00:43:21,418 --> 00:43:16,681
IN JUNE OF 2011 AFTER WE
2391
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:17,048

00:43:28,493 --> 00:43:25,556
GO AFTER THEM.
2397
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:26,023
C.I.A.
2398
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:28,493
DIRECTOR LEON PANETTA
2399
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:28,860
ASSERTED THAT
2400
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:31,429
PAKISTAN HAS NOT
2401
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:31,929
DONE ENOUGH TO BRING
2402
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:33,531

UP TO THE CHINESE.
2412
00:43:43,675 --> 00:43:42,574
IT SOUNDS TO ME
2413
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:43,141
LIKE PAKISTAN
2414
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:43,675

00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:45,577

FIRED THE FIRST SHOT.
2483
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:51,446
OF COURSE, WE CANNOT BELIEVE

2493
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:03,525

ALL
2988
00:52:39,133 --> 00:52:36,229
THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT

MY

THE

00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:48,076

2996
00:52:50,912 --> 00:52:48,410
DO WE HAVE

2998
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:50,912

00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:52,380
IF THE VALUE IS

UNDISPUTABLE,
3002
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:53,247
WHY

I
3011
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:00,622
THINK BACK TO 1787, THE

3014
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:03,725
THE CONSTITUTION
3015
00:53:06,662 --> 00:53:05,593

3016
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:06,127

00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:07,463
WOULD NOT
3019
00:53:09,865 --> 00:53:09,031
HAVE

00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:11,367

3024
00:53:14,836 --> 00:53:13,335

3032
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:21,777
RATIFY THE CONSTITUTION
3033
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:24,480
IN THE
3034
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:25,147
ABSENCE OF THE BILL OF

00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:27,517
RIGHTS.
3036
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:28,151
THE BILL

THE RIGHT

00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:44,263
ANSWER IS TO HAVE

00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:44,697

00:54:48,134 --> 00:54:46,265

WHEN I WAS GROWING

00:54:57,511 --> 00:54:56,209
WOULD BE, BUT
3129
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:56,710
THERE
3130
00:54:59,480 --> 00:54:57,511

00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:00,581
TAKES AN ACT OF CONGRESS
3135
00:55:02,816 --> 00:55:00,948
TO SOLVE IT.
3136
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:02,349

MR. SPEAKER?
3139
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:05,385
IT TAKES AN ACT OF CONGRESS TO

00:55:07,988 --> 00:55:05,852
SOLVE THAT BECAUSE THE
3141
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:06,620

02:17:33,575 --> 02:17:26,535
THIS SHOULD BE

4878
02:17:35,812 --> 02:17:29,103

THE COUNTRY.
4887
02:17:45,689 --> 02:17:36,312
THIS WOULD BE
4888
02:17:46,590 --> 02:17:37,647
DEVASTATING FOR A

MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT ACT

TAXES FOR 1.2 MILLION
4895
02:17:55,132 --> 02:17:45,689
NEVADANS AND 50,000
4896
02:17:55,531 --> 02:17:46,590

THE STATE.
4899
02:17:56,967 --> 02:17:48,458
WHAT
4900
02:17:57,668 --> 02:17:49,759
DOES THAT MEAN?
4901
02:17:57,968 --> 02:17:50,192
IT
4902
02:18:00,504 --> 02:17:54,430

FAMILIES IS PREVENTED.
4910
02:18:08,045 --> 02:18:00,504
AND IT MEANS
4911
02:18:09,379 --> 02:18:00,871
THAT NEVADA'S SMALL
4912
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:02,871

4913
02:18:10,614 --> 02:18:03,173

5441
02:26:43,849 --> 02:26:35,608

03:35:15,036 --> 03:35:02,523
THAT AGENDA IS
9256
03:35:16,605 --> 03:35:03,057

03:35:28,450 --> 03:35:15,036
THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T

NEED ANY HELP.
9272
03:35:30,719 --> 03:35:17,105
THEY

03:35:38,828 --> 03:35:24,746
THEY ARE

03:35:40,529 --> 03:35:25,146
REFUSING TO TAKE UP

03:35:41,030 --> 03:35:26,482
THE EXTENSION

03:35:42,865 --> 03:35:28,450
TAX CUT
9286
03:35:44,566 --> 03:35:28,951
THAT EXPIRES AT THE END
9287
03:35:45,335 --> 03:35:30,719
OF THE YEAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T
9288
03:35:46,069 --> 03:35:32,454

9293
03:35:48,972 --> 03:35:37,393
SO
9294
03:35:51,574 --> 03:35:37,693
THIS WEEK, WE CONSIDER
9295
03:35:52,275 --> 03:35:38,094
ANTI-REGULATORY BILLS THAT
9296
03:35:52,642 --> 03:35:38,828
MAKE
9297
03:35:52,975 --> 03:35:40,529
OUR
9298
03:35:55,545 --> 03:35:41,030
COUNTRY LESS SAFE AND OUR
9299
03:35:56,046 --> 03:35:42,464
CITIZENS LESS
9300
03:35:56,747 --> 03:35:42,865
HEALTHY.
9301
03:35:57,114 --> 03:35:44,566
WE'LL
9302
03:35:58,649 --> 03:35:45,335
CONSIDER A BILL THAT PUTS
9303
03:35:59,249 --> 03:35:46,069
MORE CORPORATE MONEY
9304
03:35:59,850 --> 03:35:47,003
INTO THE
9305
03:36:00,283 --> 03:35:47,370

03:36:00,784 --> 03:35:47,737
SYSTEM.
9307
03:36:01,217 --> 03:35:48,671
AND WE'LL
9308
03:36:02,652 --> 03:35:48,972
DEBATE A BILL THAT
9309
03:36:03,186 --> 03:35:51,574
MAKES IT HARDER
9310
03:36:04,721 --> 03:35:52,275
FOR WORKERS TO
9311
03:36:05,154 --> 03:35:52,642
ORGANIZE.
9312
03:36:06,257 --> 03:35:52,975
NOT ONE OF THESE
9313
03:36:07,057 --> 03:35:55,545
BILLS WILL PUT
9314
03:36:07,524 --> 03:35:56,046
PEOPLE BACK
9315
03:36:07,825 --> 03:35:56,747
TO WORK.
9316
03:36:09,159 --> 03:35:57,114
NOT ONE WILL
9317
03:36:10,761 --> 03:35:58,649
HELP STRUGGLING
9318
03:36:11,495 --> 03:35:59,249
FAMILIES KEEP THEIR HEAT ON

03:36:12,362 --> 03:35:59,850
DURING THE WINNER.
9320
03:36:13,163 --> 03:36:00,283
NOT ONE WILL
9321
03:36:14,664 --> 03:36:00,784
HELP REPAIR OUR

INFRASTRUCTURE.
9324
03:36:16,567 --> 03:36:03,186
TO QUOTE MR.
9325
03:36:17,068 --> 03:36:04,721
BARTLETT AGAIN,
9326
03:36:17,435 --> 03:36:05,154
PEOPLE
9327
03:36:18,002 --> 03:36:06,257
ARE INCREASINGLY
9328
03:36:19,203 --> 03:36:07,057
CONCERNED
9329
03:36:21,005 --> 03:36:07,524
ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT,
9330
03:36:21,338 --> 03:36:07,825
BUT
9331
03:36:22,740 --> 03:36:09,159
REPUBLICANS HAVE NOTHING TO
9332
03:36:23,374 --> 03:36:10,761
OFFER THEM, END QUOTE.
9333
03:36:24,241 --> 03:36:11,495
AND THAT'S THE
9334
03:36:25,042 --> 03:36:12,362
TRUTH, MADAM
9335
03:36:25,443 --> 03:36:13,163
SPEAKER.
9336
03:36:27,512 --> 03:36:14,664
REPUBLICANS HAVE ABSOLUTELY
9337
03:36:28,379 --> 03:36:15,031
NOTHING TO OFFER.
9338
03:36:29,113 --> 03:36:16,100
THE
9339
03:36:30,815 --> 03:36:16,567
PRESIDENT PROPOSED AND I
9340
03:36:31,149 --> 03:36:17,068
HAVE
9341
03:36:32,784 --> 03:36:17,435
CO-SPONSORED THE AMERICAN
9342
03:36:33,217 --> 03:36:18,002
JOBS BILL.
9343
03:36:34,352 --> 03:36:19,203
IT'S A PROPOSAL
9344
03:36:35,219 --> 03:36:21,005
THAT WOULD HELP
9345
03:36:35,554 --> 03:36:21,338
PUT
9346
03:36:36,855 --> 03:36:22,740
AMERICANS BACK TO WORK.
9347
03:36:37,255 --> 03:36:23,374
IT WOULD
9348
03:36:39,091 --> 03:36:24,241
EXTEND THE PAYROLL TAX
9349
03:36:39,424 --> 03:36:25,042
CUT
9350
03:36:41,126 --> 03:36:25,443
AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.
9351
03:36:41,693 --> 03:36:27,512
WOULD HELP REPAIR
9352
03:36:41,893 --> 03:36:28,379
OUR
9353
03:36:43,161 --> 03:36:29,113
AGING
9354
03:36:43,728 --> 03:36:30,815
INFRASTRUCTURE AND
9355
03:36:45,063 --> 03:36:31,149
WOULD
9356
03:36:45,764 --> 03:36:32,784
PROVIDE AID TO CITIES AND
9357
03:36:46,832 --> 03:36:33,217
STATES SO THEY DON'T HAVE
9358
03:36:47,199 --> 03:36:34,352
TO
9359
03:36:47,666 --> 03:36:35,219
LAY OFF MORE
9360
03:36:48,367 --> 03:36:35,554
TEACHERS AND
9361
03:36:48,968 --> 03:36:36,855
POLICE OFFICERS AND
9362
03:36:49,301 --> 03:36:37,255
MORE
9363
03:36:49,802 --> 03:36:39,091
FIREFIGHTERS.
9364
03:36:50,636 --> 03:36:39,424
IT'S A BILL
9365
03:36:52,070 --> 03:36:41,126
THAT IS PAID FOR.
9366
03:36:52,571 --> 03:36:41,693
IT DOESN'T ADD
9367
03:36:53,505 --> 03:36:41,893
ONE CENT TO THE
9368
03:36:53,905 --> 03:36:43,161
DEFICIT.
9369
03:36:54,506 --> 03:36:43,728
AND IT'S
9370
03:36:56,376 --> 03:36:45,063
MADE UP OF MEASURES
9371
03:36:56,709 --> 03:36:45,764
THAT
9372
03:36:58,277 --> 03:36:46,832
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
9373
03:36:58,911 --> 03:36:47,199
HAVE SUPPORTED IN THE
9374
03:36:59,478 --> 03:36:47,666
PAST.
9375
03:37:00,079 --> 03:36:48,367
LET ME REPEAT THAT.
9376
03:37:01,981 --> 03:36:48,968
WHAT THE PRESIDENT
9377
03:37:02,648 --> 03:36:49,301
HAS PROPOSED
9378
03:37:02,982 --> 03:36:49,802
ARE
9379
03:37:04,683 --> 03:36:50,636
A SERIES OF MEASURES THAT
9380
03:37:05,452 --> 03:36:52,070
REPUBLICANS AN DEMOCRATS HAVE
9381
03:37:06,086 --> 03:36:52,571
SUPPORTED IN THE PAST.
9382
03:37:07,654 --> 03:36:53,505
THE
9383
03:37:09,422 --> 03:36:53,905
IDEA THAT A PROGRAM WAS
9384
03:37:09,756 --> 03:36:54,506
GOOD
9385
03:37:11,457 --> 03:36:56,376
UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH BUT
9386
03:37:11,891 --> 03:36:56,709
NOT UNDER
9387
03:37:13,393 --> 03:36:58,277
PRESIDENT OBAMA
9388
03:37:13,960 --> 03:36:58,911
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH
9389
03:37:15,362 --> 03:36:59,478
SENSE TO ME
9390
03:37:15,863 --> 03:37:00,079
BUT THAT SEEMS
9391
03:37:16,630 --> 03:37:01,981
TO BE THE
9392
03:37:17,030 --> 03:37:02,648
THOUGHT
9393
03:37:18,398 --> 03:37:02,982
PROCESS THAT PASSES FOR
9394
03:37:18,999 --> 03:37:04,683
GOVERNING UNDER THIS
9395
03:37:19,666 --> 03:37:05,452
REPUBLICAN
9396
03:37:20,267 --> 03:37:06,086
LEADERSHIP SYSTEM OF
9397
03:37:20,567 --> 03:37:07,654
WHERE IS
9398
03:37:20,901 --> 03:37:09,422
THE
9399
03:37:22,435 --> 03:37:09,756
REPUBLICAN PLAN?
9400
03:37:23,036 --> 03:37:11,457
THEY DON'T HAVE ONE.
9401
03:37:23,837 --> 03:37:11,891
IT'S NOT
9402
03:37:25,540 --> 03:37:13,393
ENOUGH TO CROSS OUR
9403
03:37:25,940 --> 03:37:13,960
FINGERS
9404
03:37:27,608 --> 03:37:15,362
AND HOPE OUR ECONOMY
9405
03:37:28,042 --> 03:37:15,863
IMPROVES.
9406
03:37:29,110 --> 03:37:16,630
IT'S IN THE ENOUGH
9407
03:37:29,743 --> 03:37:17,030
TO CLOSE OUR
9408
03:37:30,077 --> 03:37:18,398
EYES
9409
03:37:31,779 --> 03:37:18,999
AND WISH MORE PEOPLE WOULD

03:37:32,112 --> 03:37:19,666

03:39:43,515 --> 03:39:30,135
REFERRED TO REPUBLICANS.
9552
03:39:45,283 --> 03:39:31,803
EITHER THEY DON'T CARE
9553
03:39:46,619 --> 03:39:32,170
ABOUT

03:39:47,086 --> 03:39:33,705
THE ECONOMY,
9555
03:39:48,654 --> 03:39:34,072
OR THEY ARE JUST
9556
03:39:49,088 --> 03:39:35,674
ACTING FOR
9557
03:39:51,690 --> 03:39:36,375
POLITICAL GAIN.
9558
03:39:52,157 --> 03:39:36,642
IS THAT ALL
9559
03:39:52,958 --> 03:39:38,277
THERE IS?
9560
03:39:53,325 --> 03:39:39,044
EITHER
9561
03:39:55,695 --> 03:39:39,444
FOLKS DON'T CARE, OR
9562
03:39:56,162 --> 03:39:39,745
THEY'RE JUST
9563
03:39:57,065 --> 03:39:41,580
ACTING FOR GAIN.
9564
03:39:57,363 --> 03:39:42,180
IT
9565
03:39:58,831 --> 03:39:42,848
COULD BE THAT THEIR
9566
03:39:59,332 --> 03:39:43,515

9567
03:39:59,966 --> 03:39:45,283
DIFFERENT.
9568
03:40:00,266 --> 03:39:46,619
IT
9569
03:40:01,234 --> 03:39:47,086

9571
03:40:02,268 --> 03:39:49,088

03:40:03,035 --> 03:39:51,690
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
9573
03:40:04,470 --> 03:39:52,157

03:40:05,237 --> 03:39:53,325
THE SAME
9576
03:40:06,740 --> 03:39:55,695

9578
03:40:07,941 --> 03:39:57,065

03:40:38,039 --> 03:40:24,224
COMING TO AND
9608
03:40:38,439 --> 03:40:25,058
WORK ON

THESE ISSUES WHO SIT,
9610
03:40:40,508 --> 03:40:26,861
MADAM SPEAKER THAT DOES
9611
03:40:40,875 --> 03:40:27,228
NOT
9612
03:40:41,342 --> 03:40:28,296
BELIEVE THAT
9613
03:40:42,743 --> 03:40:30,364
REGULATION TO
9614
03:40:43,311 --> 03:40:31,799
PROTECT HEALTH AND
9615
03:40:44,078 --> 03:40:32,132
SAFETY IS
9616
03:40:44,512 --> 03:40:33,701
IMPORTANT.
9617
03:40:44,912 --> 03:40:34,168

9618
03:40:45,447 --> 03:40:35,135
I COME FROM ONE

COUNTRY.
9622
03:40:49,317 --> 03:40:38,039
I BELIEVE HEALTH
9623
03:40:50,051 --> 03:40:38,439
AND SAFETY ARE
9624
03:40:50,485 --> 03:40:39,841
IMPORTANT
9625
03:40:51,019 --> 03:40:40,508
THINGS TO REGULATE.
9626
03:40:52,087 --> 03:40:40,875
BUT
9627
03:40:53,722 --> 03:40:41,342
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BALANCE
9628
03:40:54,289 --> 03:40:42,743
THOSE REGULATIONS.
9629
03:40:54,993 --> 03:40:43,311
YOU
9630
03:40:56,759 --> 03:40:44,078

03:41:00,262 --> 03:40:47,816

03:41:03,131 --> 03:40:49,317
2009, WHERE DO YOU THINK
9638
03:41:03,932 --> 03:40:50,051
THAT MONEY WENT, MADAM SPEAKER.
9639
03:41:04,266 --> 03:40:50,485
THE
9640
03:41:05,868 --> 03:40:51,019
ENVIRONMENT THAT I LIVE IN
9641
03:41:06,302 --> 03:40:52,087

2008.
9645
03:41:09,438 --> 03:40:56,759
BUT WHEN YOU

03:41:11,407 --> 03:40:58,093

03:41:13,709 --> 03:40:58,994
REGULATORS, THEY HAVE ONLY ONE
9650
03:41:14,643 --> 03:40:59,928
THING THEY CAN DO WITH
9651
03:41:14,977 --> 03:41:00,262
IT, AN

REGULATE MORE.
9654
03:41:19,215 --> 03:41:04,266

9656
03:41:21,517 --> 03:41:06,302

03:45:20,801 --> 03:45:04,250
AMENDMENT WAS NOT
9900
03:45:23,303 --> 03:45:04,783

03:45:23,703 --> 03:45:05,418
MY

THAT WAS
9906
03:45:27,408 --> 03:45:12,825
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR.
9907
03:45:28,008 --> 03:45:13,292
KNOWING THAT TIME IS
9908
03:45:28,809 --> 03:45:16,597
VALUABLE
9909
03:45:29,176 --> 03:45:17,030

WE PROVIDED

03:45:48,663 --> 03:45:28,008
TIME TO DO THAT.
9923
03:45:49,097 --> 03:45:28,809
BUT I WANT
9924
03:45:50,832 --> 03:45:29,176
TO DEFEND THIS RULE
9925
03:45:51,466 --> 03:45:31,712
AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT

03:45:53,735 --> 03:45:36,084
DO.
9929
03:45:54,068 --> 03:45:38,920
IT'S
9930
03:45:56,004 --> 03:45:39,353
IS IT A LITTLE MORE CONVOW
9931
03:45:56,305 --> 03:45:43,624
--
9932
03:45:58,774 --> 03:45:44,125
IS IT A LITTLE MORE
9933
03:45:59,207 --> 03:45:45,660
CONVOLUTED
9934
03:46:01,743 --> 03:45:46,094

9935
03:46:02,077 --> 03:45:46,962
YES,
9936
03:46:04,779 --> 03:45:47,429
IT IS.
9937
03:46:05,080 --> 03:45:48,663
IT
9938
03:46:06,949 --> 03:45:49,097
PROVIDES FOR TIME FOR DEBATE
9939
03:46:07,249 --> 03:45:50,832
ON
9940
03:46:09,985 --> 03:45:51,466

ON

03:54:29,205 --> 03:54:13,122
MIDDLE-CLASS
10445
03:54:30,707 --> 03:54:15,625
AMERICANS?
10446
03:54:31,341 --> 03:54:16,192
MR. WOODALL: MY FRIEND
10447
03:54:31,875 --> 03:54:17,694
FLATTERS
10448
03:54:32,242 --> 03:54:18,294
ME BY
10449
03:54:33,209 --> 03:54:18,995
THINKING I HAVE THE
10450
03:54:33,877 --> 03:54:20,796
INFORMATION AS A YOUNG
10451
03:54:34,978 --> 03:54:21,197
FRESHMAN
10452
03:54:35,446 --> 03:54:21,998
ON THE HOUSE
10453
03:54:35,979 --> 03:54:23,132
FLOOR.
10454
03:54:36,347 --> 03:54:24,567
BUT I
10455
03:54:37,881 --> 03:54:24,900
WILL TELL YOU THIS, I
10456
03:54:38,482 --> 03:54:27,671
TELL YOU TWO THINGS
10457
03:54:39,049 --> 03:54:28,371
ARE TRUE.
10458
03:54:39,383 --> 03:54:28,738
IT'S
10459
03:54:41,852 --> 03:54:29,205
A PUZZLER FOR ME ON THE
10460
03:54:42,553 --> 03:54:30,707
PAYROLL TAX HOLIDAY THAT'S
10461
03:54:42,953 --> 03:54:31,341

03:54:43,987 --> 03:54:32,242
YEAR.
10464
03:54:44,421 --> 03:54:33,209
ON THE ONE
10465
03:54:46,857 --> 03:54:33,877
HAND I WILL TELL YOU
10466
03:54:47,191 --> 03:54:34,978
THAT
10467
03:54:48,826 --> 03:54:35,446
REPUBLICANS ARE PART OF
10468
03:54:49,360 --> 03:54:35,979
LOWER TAXES, NOT
10469
03:54:50,928 --> 03:54:36,347
HIGHER TAXES.
10470
03:54:51,428 --> 03:54:37,881
THAT SPEAKS TO
10471
03:54:52,062 --> 03:54:38,482
THIS ISSUE.
10472
03:54:52,429 --> 03:54:39,049
WE'RE
10473
03:54:53,964 --> 03:54:39,383
ALSO THE PARTY OF MAKING
10474
03:54:54,398 --> 03:54:41,852
SURE THAT
10475
03:54:55,199 --> 03:54:42,553
WE'RE PAYING FOR
10476
03:54:55,567 --> 03:54:42,953
THOSE
10477
03:54:56,968 --> 03:54:43,353
COMMITMENTS THAT WE'RE
10478
03:54:57,369 --> 03:54:43,987
MAKING.
10479
03:54:58,136 --> 03:54:44,421
SOCIAL SECURITY IS DIFFERENT
10480
03:54:58,536 --> 03:54:46,857
FROM ANY
10481
03:54:59,103 --> 03:54:47,191
OTHER TAX IN THAT
10482
03:54:59,937 --> 03:54:48,826
WHEN
10483
03:55:00,438 --> 03:54:49,360
I GO AND TALK
10484
03:55:01,839 --> 03:54:50,928
TO MY GRANDFATHER
10485
03:55:02,373 --> 03:54:51,428
HE SAYS, ROB, I
10486
03:55:03,174 --> 03:54:52,062
WANT THAT
10487
03:55:03,708 --> 03:54:52,429
SOCIAL SECURITY.
10488
03:55:04,275 --> 03:54:53,964
I PAID INTO IT ALL
10489
03:55:05,844 --> 03:54:54,398
MY LIFE.
10490
03:55:06,511 --> 03:54:55,199
WELL, WE ARE NOT PAYING
10491
03:55:07,012 --> 03:54:55,567
INTO IT
10492
03:55:07,379 --> 03:54:56,968
RIGHT
10493
03:55:07,979 --> 03:54:57,369
NOW.
10494
03:55:08,580 --> 03:54:58,136
THE PROPOSAL IS NOT
10495
03:55:09,080 --> 03:54:58,536

10496
03:55:09,481 --> 03:54:59,103
IT NEXT
10497
03:55:09,981 --> 03:54:59,937
YEAR.
10498
03:55:10,448 --> 03:55:00,438
THE PROPOSAL
10499
03:55:11,149 --> 03:55:01,839
WAS NOT TO PAY
10500
03:55:11,483 --> 03:55:02,373
INTO
10501
03:55:12,817 --> 03:55:03,174
IT LAST YEAR.
10502
03:55:13,418 --> 03:55:03,708
I'D BE INTERESTED TO
10503
03:55:13,985 --> 03:55:04,275
ASK MY
10504
03:55:14,419 --> 03:55:05,844
FRIEND IF
10505
03:55:16,055 --> 03:55:06,511
HE'S PREPARED TO
10506
03:55:16,588 --> 03:55:07,012
SUPPORT LOWERING

03:55:16,889 --> 03:55:07,379

SOCIAL
10509
03:55:18,791 --> 03:55:08,580
SECURITY BENEFITS BECAUSE,
10510
03:55:19,257 --> 03:55:09,080
AGAIN, THIS
10511
03:55:19,958 --> 03:55:09,481
IS --
10512
03:55:20,292 --> 03:55:09,981
MR.
10513
03:55:21,426 --> 03:55:10,448

10517
03:55:23,395 --> 03:55:13,418
MR.

03:55:25,898 --> 03:55:13,985
ANDREWS: I WILL NOT SUPPORT
10519
03:55:26,265 --> 03:55:14,419
THAT.
10520
03:55:26,666 --> 03:55:16,055
I WANT A
10521
03:55:27,099 --> 03:55:16,588
SURTAX ON PEOPLE

03:55:29,935 --> 03:55:19,257
IT.
10526
03:55:30,302 --> 03:55:19,958
LET ME
10527
03:55:31,237 --> 03:55:20,292
ASK THE GENTLEMAN
10528
03:55:31,637 --> 03:55:21,426
ANOTHER
10529
03:55:31,937 --> 03:55:21,793
QUESTION.
10530
03:55:33,339 --> 03:55:22,294
I UNDERSTAND
10531
03:55:34,106 --> 03:55:23,061
THERE ARE
10532
03:55:34,640 --> 03:55:23,395
DIFFERING VIEWS
10533
03:55:35,174 --> 03:55:25,898
IN HIS PARTY
10534
03:55:35,508 --> 03:55:26,265
AND
10535
03:55:36,943 --> 03:55:26,666
FRANKLY OURS AS TO WHETHER
10536
03:55:37,243 --> 03:55:27,099

03:55:38,878 --> 03:55:28,401
EXTENSION OF THE TAX CUT FOR
10538
03:55:39,345 --> 03:55:29,101
MIDDLE-CLASS
10539
03:55:40,179 --> 03:55:29,468
FAMILIES SHOULD
10540
03:55:40,613 --> 03:55:29,935
CONTINUE.
10541
03:55:41,380 --> 03:55:30,302
AND I'M NOT
10542
03:55:42,215 --> 03:55:31,237
ASKING HIM TO SAY
10543
03:55:42,515 --> 03:55:31,637
IT
10544
03:55:43,783 --> 03:55:31,937
WOULD PASS.
10545
03:55:44,352 --> 03:55:33,339
THAT'S BEYOND THE
10546
03:55:45,919 --> 03:55:34,106
REACH OF ANY
10547
03:55:46,320 --> 03:55:34,640

10548
03:55:46,720 --> 03:55:35,174
EVEN THE

03:55:47,387 --> 03:55:36,943
BUT IS

03:55:50,423 --> 03:55:39,345
AMERICAN PEOPLE,

10556
03:55:52,926 --> 03:55:41,380

10557
03:55:53,560 --> 03:55:42,215
THE MAJORITY WORK ITS

03:55:54,060 --> 03:55:42,515

OR NO ON AVOIDING THIS
10561
03:55:56,564 --> 03:55:45,919
TAX INCREASE

03:55:59,166 --> 03:55:47,020
MR. WOODALL: WELL, I WOULD SAY

MY FRIEND THAT THE MAJORITY,

03:56:04,037 --> 03:55:50,423
SPEAKING OUT AS A YOUNG

FRESHMAN
10570
03:56:07,808 --> 03:55:51,491
BUT I KNOW ENOUGH

03:56:09,844 --> 03:55:53,560
LEADERSHIP THAT THE

03:56:10,478 --> 03:55:54,060
MAJORITY IS PROTECTING
10574
03:56:11,045 --> 03:55:54,461
SOCIAL
10575
03:56:11,679 --> 03:55:56,096
SECURITY, NOT JUST FOR
10576
03:56:11,980 --> 03:55:56,564
THIS
10577
03:56:12,546 --> 03:55:57,931
GENERATION BUT THE
10578
03:56:12,980 --> 03:55:58,365
NEXT
10579
03:56:13,414 --> 03:55:59,166
GENERATION
10580
03:56:14,815 --> 03:55:59,466
AND BEYOND.
10581
03:56:15,416 --> 03:56:00,304
AND THE QUESTION IS
10582
03:56:16,051 --> 03:56:01,235
GOING TO
10583
03:56:16,384 --> 03:56:04,037
BE,
10584
03:56:18,086 --> 03:56:04,438
CAN WE FIND A PROPOSAL --
10585
03:56:18,753 --> 03:56:07,808
BECAUSE THE ONE THAT WAS
10586
03:56:19,020 --> 03:56:08,242
PASSED
10587
03:56:19,521 --> 03:56:09,844
LAST YEAR WAS
10588
03:56:20,154 --> 03:56:10,478
NOT A PROPOSAL
10589
03:56:20,488 --> 03:56:11,045
THAT
10590
03:56:20,857 --> 03:56:11,679
BOTH
10591
03:56:22,256 --> 03:56:11,980
LOWERED TAX BURDENS
10592
03:56:22,590 --> 03:56:12,546
AND
10593
03:56:23,024 --> 03:56:12,980
PROTECTED THE
10594
03:56:24,092 --> 03:56:13,414
SOLVENCY OF
10595
03:56:24,559 --> 03:56:14,815
MEDICARE AND
10596
03:56:26,194 --> 03:56:15,416
SOCIAL SECURITY.
10597
03:56:26,628 --> 03:56:16,051
WE MUST BE
10598
03:56:26,929 --> 03:56:16,384
SURE NOT
10599
03:56:28,130 --> 03:56:18,086
TO FURTHER
10600
03:56:28,563 --> 03:56:18,753
BANKRUPT A
10601
03:56:29,831 --> 03:56:19,020
PROGRAM THAT WE ALL
10602
03:56:30,465 --> 03:56:19,521
AGREE IS ALREADY GOING
10603
03:56:31,399 --> 03:56:20,154
BANKRUPT.
10604
03:56:32,033 --> 03:56:20,488
I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT
10605
03:56:33,034 --> 03:56:20,857
DEBATE,
10606
03:56:33,535 --> 03:56:22,256
MADAM SPEAKER,
10607
03:56:34,836 --> 03:56:22,590
BETWEEN NOW AND
10608
03:56:35,504 --> 03:56:23,024
THE END OF THE YEAR, AND
10609
03:56:36,872 --> 03:56:24,092
IT'S
10610
03:56:37,373 --> 03:56:24,559
NOT JUST THAT
10611
03:56:38,274 --> 03:56:26,194
TAX THAT'S
10612
03:56:38,707 --> 03:56:26,628
EXPIRING.
10613
03:56:39,141 --> 03:56:26,929
I KNOW MY
10614
03:56:40,342 --> 03:56:28,130
FRIEND IS ALSO
10615
03:56:40,776 --> 03:56:28,563
CONCERNED
10616
03:56:41,076 --> 03:56:29,831
ABOUT THE
10617
03:56:42,311 --> 03:56:30,465
BUSH-OBAMA
10618
03:56:42,811 --> 03:56:31,399
TAX CUTS THAT
10619
03:56:43,245 --> 03:56:32,033
WERE EXTENDED
10620
03:56:44,212 --> 03:56:33,034
IN
10621
03:56:44,680 --> 03:56:33,535
DECEMBER OF
10622
03:56:46,115 --> 03:56:34,836
2010 AND WANTS TO
10623
03:56:46,683 --> 03:56:35,504
BE SURE THAT THOSE
10624
03:56:47,283 --> 03:56:36,872
WILL BE
10625
03:56:47,750 --> 03:56:37,373
EXTENDED IN
10626
03:56:49,218 --> 03:56:38,274
2011.
10627
03:56:49,619 --> 03:56:38,707
AND INTO
10628
03:56:51,254 --> 03:56:39,141
2013.
10629
03:56:51,721 --> 03:56:40,342
MR. ANDREWS:
10630
03:56:53,089 --> 03:56:40,776
THOSE INCOME TAX
10631
03:56:53,622 --> 03:56:41,076
REDUCTIONS WERE
10632
03:56:55,057 --> 03:56:42,311
EXTENDED
10633
03:56:55,592 --> 03:56:42,811
THROUGH DECEMBER
10634
03:56:57,127 --> 03:56:43,245
31 OF 2012.
10635
03:56:57,560 --> 03:56:44,212
SO THERE'S
10636
03:57:00,096 --> 03:56:44,680
NOT AN URGENT
10637
03:57:00,730 --> 03:56:46,115
IMMINENT TO ADDRESSING
10638
03:57:01,231 --> 03:56:46,683
THAT
10639
03:57:01,731 --> 03:56:47,283
ISSUE AS THERE
10640
03:57:02,298 --> 03:56:47,750
IS TO THIS.
10641
03:57:02,599 --> 03:56:49,218
I
10642
03:57:04,133 --> 03:56:49,619
PUT THE QUESTION THIS WAY.
10643
03:57:04,434 --> 03:56:51,254
I
10644
03:57:05,669 --> 03:56:51,721
FULLY UNDERSTAND THERE ARE
10645
03:57:06,303 --> 03:56:53,089
DIFFERENT VIEWS AS TO
10646
03:57:07,304 --> 03:56:53,622
WHETHER
10647
03:57:07,838 --> 03:56:55,057
OR NOT WE SHOULD
10648
03:57:10,107 --> 03:56:55,592
AVOID THIS
10649
03:57:10,674 --> 03:56:57,127
MIDDLE-CLASS TAX I
10650
03:57:11,274 --> 03:56:57,560
CREASE.
10651
03:57:11,608 --> 03:57:00,096
I'M
10652
03:57:13,310 --> 03:57:00,730
SIMPLY ASKING WHETHER --
10653
03:57:13,643 --> 03:57:01,231
TAX
10654
03:57:15,111 --> 03:57:01,731
INCREASE.
10655
03:57:15,680 --> 03:57:02,298
I'M SIMPLY ASKING
10656
03:57:17,281 --> 03:57:02,599
WHETHER THE
10657
03:57:18,015 --> 03:57:04,133
GENTLEMAN SUPPORTS GIVING US
10658
03:57:18,282 --> 03:57:04,434
A
10659
03:57:18,649 --> 03:57:05,669
CLEAR
10660
03:57:21,285 --> 03:57:06,303
UP-DOWN VOTE ON ALLOWING
10661
03:57:21,819 --> 03:57:07,304
THAT TO HAPPEN?
10662
03:57:22,820 --> 03:57:07,838
MR. WOODALL:
10663
03:57:25,255 --> 03:57:10,107
I HAPPEN TO
10664
03:57:25,657 --> 03:57:10,674
SUPPORT
10665
03:57:27,592 --> 03:57:11,274
UP-DOWN VOTES ON ALL
10666
03:57:27,992 --> 03:57:11,608
SORTS OF
10667
03:57:28,459 --> 03:57:13,310
THINGS.
10668
03:57:28,760 --> 03:57:13,643
I
10669
03:57:30,528 --> 03:57:15,111
BELIEVE THE HOUSE WORKS BEST
10670
03:57:30,862 --> 03:57:15,680
WHEN
10671
03:57:33,297 --> 03:57:17,281
THEY WORK ITS WILL.
10672
03:57:33,864 --> 03:57:18,015
THAT'S THE CHANGES
10673
03:57:35,633 --> 03:57:18,282
WE HAVE SEEN
10674
03:57:36,401 --> 03:57:18,649
THIS YEAR WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN
10675
03:57:37,836 --> 03:57:21,285
YEARS' PAST.
10676
03:57:39,004 --> 03:57:21,819
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT,
10677
03:57:39,504 --> 03:57:22,820
MADAM
10678
03:57:39,971 --> 03:57:25,255

03:57:42,507 --> 03:57:27,992
FLOOR.
10682
03:57:43,007 --> 03:57:28,459
BUT IT'S ALSO
10683
03:57:43,741 --> 03:57:28,760
IMPORTANT TO MAKE
10684
03:57:44,175 --> 03:57:30,528
SURE THAT
10685
03:57:44,642 --> 03:57:30,862

03:57:45,978 --> 03:57:33,297

03:57:47,346 --> 03:57:33,864
SAME WAY
10688
03:57:47,980 --> 03:57:35,633
FOLKS MIGHT BE TEMPTED
10689
03:57:49,515 --> 03:57:36,401

03:57:50,315 --> 03:57:37,836

CHICANNORY.
10697
03:57:59,892 --> 03:57:43,007

NO CONSEQUENCE AT

03:58:06,166 --> 03:57:47,980
ALL.
10704
03:58:06,599 --> 03:57:49,515
THERE ARE
10705
03:58:07,800 --> 03:57:50,315
CONSEQUENCES TO THIS
10706
03:58:08,234 --> 03:57:50,949
DECISION.
10707
03:58:08,868 --> 03:57:51,616
I SAY TO MY

10713
03:58:15,107 --> 03:58:02,328

10802
03:59:27,317 --> 03:59:15,103
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

TOUTED HERE I
11263
04:06:50,378 --> 04:06:38,532
QUESTION.
11264
04:06:50,712 --> 04:06:38,999
VERY
11265
04:06:52,880 --> 04:06:40,000
SERIOUSLY.
11266
04:06:53,281 --> 04:06:40,534
O.M.B.'S
11267
04:06:54,248 --> 04:06:41,235
CALCULATIONS
11268
04:06:54,715 --> 04:06:42,069
DEMONSTRATE
11269
04:06:55,984 --> 04:06:42,436
THAT REGULATION HAS
11270
04:06:56,485 --> 04:06:43,070
A POSITIVE NET
11271
04:06:57,352 --> 04:06:44,071
EFFECT ON THE

11273
04:07:00,121 --> 04:06:46,441
AND NOT BY A LITTLE.
11274
04:07:00,522 --> 04:06:47,142
IN 2008
11275
04:07:02,290 --> 04:06:48,009
THE BUSH
11276
04:07:02,824 --> 04:06:48,443
ADMINISTRATION'S
11277
04:07:03,091 --> 04:06:49,944
O.M.B.
11278
04:07:04,626 --> 04:06:50,378
ESTIMATED THAT
11279
04:07:06,061 --> 04:06:50,712
REGULATORY COSTS
11280
04:07:06,595 --> 04:06:52,880
FOR MAJOR RULES
11281
04:07:08,097 --> 04:06:53,281
WERE BETWEEN $46
11282
04:07:08,564 --> 04:06:54,248
BILLION AND
11283
04:07:10,365 --> 04:06:54,715
$54 BILLION.
11284
04:07:10,766 --> 04:06:55,984
AND THE
11285
04:07:12,134 --> 04:06:56,485
BENEFITS OF THOSE
11286
04:07:12,801 --> 04:06:57,352
REGULATIONS WAS BETWEEN
11287
04:07:14,336 --> 04:06:57,753
$122
11288
04:07:14,803 --> 04:07:00,121
BILLION AND
11289
04:07:19,175 --> 04:07:00,522
$656 BILLION.
11290
04:07:19,709 --> 04:07:02,290
SO IT GOES BACK
11291
04:07:21,143 --> 04:07:02,824
TO THE POINT I
11292
04:07:21,577 --> 04:07:03,091
WAS MAKING
11293
04:07:25,214 --> 04:07:04,626
EARLIER AND THAT IS,
11294
04:07:25,782 --> 04:07:06,061
WHAT WE SHOULD BE
11295
04:07:27,283 --> 04:07:06,595

TO WORK.
11300
04:07:32,889 --> 04:07:12,134
WE SHOULD
11301
04:07:35,224 --> 04:07:12,801
BE EXTENDING THE

04:07:35,759 --> 04:07:14,336
PAYROLL TAX CUT.
11303
04:07:36,059 --> 04:07:14,803
WE
11304
04:07:36,460 --> 04:07:19,175

04:07:42,832 --> 04:07:27,750
WE SHOULD BE DOING
11312
04:07:43,600 --> 04:07:31,354
THINGS THAT
11313
04:07:44,134 --> 04:07:31,921
WILL MAKE A REAL
11314
04:07:44,601 --> 04:07:32,455
DIFFERENCE IN
11315
04:07:45,001 --> 04:07:32,889

04:36:36,741 --> 04:36:18,121
WORKER WANTED TO BE IN THE
13065
04:36:37,141 --> 04:36:18,588
UNION OR
13066
04:36:37,909 --> 04:36:19,623
NOT.
13067
04:36:38,276 --> 04:36:19,922
A VERY
13068
04:36:39,743 --> 04:36:21,658
FAIR PROCESS.
13069
04:36:40,311 --> 04:36:22,158
IF THIS RULE GOES
13070
04:36:41,846 --> 04:36:23,359
INTO EFFECT AS
13071
04:36:42,512 --> 04:36:24,760
HE SAID, SEVEN DAYS FOR
13072
04:36:42,980 --> 04:36:25,428
AN
13073
04:36:43,380 --> 04:36:25,863
EMPLOYER
13074
04:36:44,314 --> 04:36:26,197
TO FIND REPRESENTATION
13075
04:36:44,615 --> 04:36:28,899
TO
13076
04:36:49,087 --> 04:36:29,433
GO THROUGH OVER 400 PAGES OF
13077
04:36:49,787 --> 04:36:30,667
RULES, ON THIS VERY
13078
04:36:50,288 --> 04:36:31,367
COMPLICATED
13079
04:36:50,687 --> 04:36:32,069
SUBJECT,
13080
04:36:51,022 --> 04:36:32,368
IT
13081
04:36:54,058 --> 04:36:33,369
GETS WORSE.
13082
04:36:54,525 --> 04:36:34,037
RELY ONLY 10
13083
04:36:55,458 --> 04:36:34,937
DAYS, AS LITTLE AS
13084
04:36:55,760 --> 04:36:35,238
10
13085
04:36:57,129 --> 04:36:36,741
DAYS, TO VOTE.
13086
04:36:57,762 --> 04:36:37,141
SO A WORKER WOULD HAVE
13087
04:36:58,330 --> 04:36:37,909
TO MAKE
13088
04:36:58,830 --> 04:36:38,276
THEIR MIND UP
13089
04:37:00,198 --> 04:36:39,743
IN SOME CASES, IT
13090
04:37:00,765 --> 04:36:40,311
COULD BE AS QUICK
13091
04:37:04,169 --> 04:36:41,846
AS 10 DAYS.
13092
04:37:04,736 --> 04:36:42,512
IMAGINE VOTING ON
13093
04:37:05,504 --> 04:36:42,980
THE PRESIDENCY
13094
04:37:06,005 --> 04:36:43,380

10 DAYS.
13098
04:37:09,508 --> 04:36:49,787
IT GETS
13099
04:37:10,342 --> 04:36:50,288
WORSE.
13100
04:37:10,909 --> 04:36:50,687
WORKERS WOULD THEN
13101
04:37:11,443 --> 04:36:51,022
BE REQUIRED
13102
04:37:11,810 --> 04:36:54,058

13103
04:37:12,644 --> 04:36:54,525
TO HAND OVER PERSONAL

13105
04:37:13,744 --> 04:36:55,760
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
13106
04:37:14,312 --> 04:36:57,129
IS ALLOW THE
13107
04:37:15,915 --> 04:36:57,762
EMPLOYEE TO DECIDE WHAT
13108
04:37:16,983 --> 04:36:58,330
INFORMATION IS GIVEN TO THE

04:37:17,883 --> 04:36:58,830

13110
04:37:19,285 --> 04:37:00,198

04:37:19,719 --> 04:37:00,765

13112
04:37:20,519 --> 04:37:04,169
MR. SPEAKER -- MR. CHAIRMAN, I
13113
04:37:20,885 --> 04:37:04,736
SHOULD
13114
04:37:21,419 --> 04:37:05,504
SAY, THIS JUST
13115
04:37:22,387 --> 04:37:06,005
ISN'T
13116
04:37:22,755 --> 04:37:07,539
RIGHT.
13117
04:37:23,622 --> 04:37:07,840
NOR IS THE

HOW

04:37:28,461 --> 04:37:11,810
A BARGAINING UNIT IS
13124
04:37:28,895 --> 04:37:12,644

13125
04:37:29,528 --> 04:37:13,111
RIGHT.
13126
04:37:29,963 --> 04:37:13,744
INSTEAD OF

CREATING JOBS,
13128
04:37:32,098 --> 04:37:15,915

A MULTITUDE OF

04:37:35,001 --> 04:37:19,719
SMALL BARGAINING
13133
04:37:35,702 --> 04:37:20,519
UNITS WHICH

ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.
13140
04:37:41,041 --> 04:37:24,990
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE
13141
04:37:41,508 --> 04:37:25,357

THAT'S
13147
04:37:45,578 --> 04:37:29,963
WHY I'M A PROUD
13148
04:37:46,413 --> 04:37:31,530
CO-SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION.
13149
04:37:46,747 --> 04:37:32,098
THE

04:37:49,416 --> 04:37:32,665

13151
04:37:49,817 --> 04:37:33,166

THIS HEARING
13156
04:37:54,588 --> 04:37:36,436
WILL ALLOW BOTH

13163
04:38:00,428 --> 04:37:42,108

THIS BILL
13189
04:38:23,018 --> 04:38:02,863

13193
04:38:26,055 --> 04:38:06,201
A BARGAINING UNIT IS.
13194
04:38:26,589 --> 04:38:08,770
IT'S OVER THREE
13195
04:38:27,356 --> 04:38:09,437
DECADES OF
13196
04:38:27,723 --> 04:38:09,903

13197
04:38:29,592 --> 04:38:10,437
MR. CHAIRMAN,
13198
04:38:31,093 --> 04:38:11,806
THERE'S ONLY ONE
13199
04:38:31,526 --> 04:38:12,172
WAY I CAN
13200
04:38:33,095 --> 04:38:13,341
DESCRIBE THIS BILL AS
13201
04:38:33,596 --> 04:38:14,975

13202
04:38:34,830 --> 04:38:15,410

LAW.
13209
04:38:38,701 --> 04:38:21,348
BUT I BELIEVE THAT
13210
04:38:40,203 --> 04:38:23,018
THE UNION
13211
04:38:40,869 --> 04:38:23,617

13213
04:38:41,804 --> 04:38:24,652

04:38:47,144 --> 04:38:31,526

04:41:12,827 --> 04:40:50,337
HOW DOES

04:41:13,528 --> 04:40:51,372
IT DO THAT?
13396
04:41:13,828 --> 04:40:51,705
IT
13397
04:41:15,463 --> 04:40:55,409
STUFFS THE BALLOT BOX AT THE

04:41:15,831 --> 04:40:56,111

THAT'S JUST THE

REVERSE OF THE

14309
04:56:10,565 --> 04:55:50,610

14321
04:56:21,709 --> 04:56:03,724
IT INCREASES THE

THE FACT OF

14352
04:57:02,519 --> 04:56:40,129
THE ORIGINAL BILL PROVIDES

THIS WOULD INCLUDE

04:57:14,264 --> 04:56:55,411
REASONABLY BE EXPECTED

04:57:27,478 --> 04:57:08,291
ON THIS FACT, A HEARING
14380
04:57:27,879 --> 04:57:08,959
COULD GO
14381
04:57:29,414 --> 04:57:09,426

14382
04:57:30,081 --> 04:57:09,893
THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE

04:57:30,548 --> 04:57:10,861
OF THIS
14384
04:57:30,848 --> 04:57:12,262

FURTHERMORE, PARTIES COULD

HEARINGS.
14395
04:57:42,626 --> 04:57:24,008
THIS SEEMS TO REQUIRE
14396
04:57:43,727 --> 04:57:24,441
THAT THE

WE

05:02:10,840 --> 05:01:49,918
REALLY
14669
05:02:14,376 --> 05:01:50,819
BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY?
14670
05:02:14,943 --> 05:01:51,486
SOME OF US BELIEVE

14683
05:02:28,959 --> 05:02:05,467
WHY, THEN,
14684
05:02:30,460 --> 05:02:07,403
WOULD CORPORATIONS
14685
05:02:30,961 --> 05:02:08,037
WANT TO BLOCK

05:02:32,562 --> 05:02:09,405

14690
05:02:37,568 --> 05:02:14,376
IT'S OBVIOUS.
14691
05:02:38,102 --> 05:02:14,943
WHEN WORKERS ARE

IT
15013
05:08:03,307 --> 05:07:40,050

MR. SPEAKER,
15801
05:21:16,169 --> 05:20:56,348
LAST MONTH THE
15802
05:21:16,836 --> 05:20:56,782
C.B.O. FOUND THAT WAGES
15803
05:21:17,337 --> 05:20:58,216
HAVE
15804
05:21:17,771 --> 05:20:58,583
STAGNATED

05:21:19,939 --> 05:21:00,686
MEDIUM

15811
05:21:26,213 --> 05:21:06,459
HAS TRIPLED.
15812
05:21:26,613 --> 05:21:06,926
IT IS NO
15813
05:21:28,381 --> 05:21:07,126
COINCIDENCE THAT THIS
15814
05:21:28,882 --> 05:21:08,327
HAS HAPPENED.
15815
05:21:29,616 --> 05:21:08,727
WHILE UNION MEMBERSHIP HAS

15817
05:21:32,118 --> 05:21:10,729
BUT THE MAJORITY PERSISTS IN
15818
05:21:32,852 --> 05:21:12,197
TRYING TO

05:21:34,487 --> 05:21:12,498

15823
05:21:38,792 --> 05:21:16,836
THIS IS NOT
15824
05:21:39,793 --> 05:21:17,337
THE AMERICAN WAY AND
15825
05:21:40,160 --> 05:21:17,771
IT IS
15826
05:21:40,527 --> 05:21:19,572
NOT WHAT THE

05:21:41,561 --> 05:21:19,939

05:39:35,280 --> 05:39:16,161
LET'S REMEMBER
16903
05:39:36,047 --> 05:39:16,661
BOEING'S ON THE
16904
05:39:36,415 --> 05:39:17,929
RECORD
16905
05:39:37,683 --> 05:39:18,263
THEY DIDN'T SUPPORT THAT
16906
05:39:38,150 --> 05:39:19,731
LEGISLATION.
16907
05:39:40,152 --> 05:39:20,231
THAT WAS PUT
16908
05:39:42,888 --> 05:39:21,633
THERE IN BEHALF OF
16909
05:39:43,355 --> 05:39:22,033
THEIR NAME.
16910
05:39:44,323 --> 05:39:23,901
JUST A FEW MINUTES
16911
05:39:45,691 --> 05:39:24,302
AGO, THE
16912
05:39:46,024 --> 05:39:25,703
NLRB
16913
05:39:48,027 --> 05:39:26,238
VOTED ON A COMPROMISE RULE
16914
05:39:48,427 --> 05:39:27,806
DEALING
16915
05:39:49,829 --> 05:39:28,208
WITH LECHES.
16916
05:39:50,162 --> 05:39:29,841
THAT
16917
05:39:51,931 --> 05:39:30,275
COMPROMISE RULE HOPEFULLY
16918
05:39:52,465 --> 05:39:31,076
WILL NOW BECOME
16919
05:39:53,065 --> 05:39:32,877
A PERMANENT
16920
05:39:53,399 --> 05:39:33,345
RULE
16921
05:39:54,934 --> 05:39:34,045
AND THAT WILL GO FORWARD.
16922
05:39:55,301 --> 05:39:34,479
THAT'S
16923
05:39:57,103 --> 05:39:35,280
WHAT THE NLR BMBING
16924
05:39:57,470 --> 05:39:36,047
DOES.
16925
05:39:57,937 --> 05:39:36,415
IT WORKS OUT
16926
05:39:59,105 --> 05:39:37,683
ARRANGEMENTS
16927
05:39:59,739 --> 05:39:38,150
BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND
16928
05:40:01,074 --> 05:39:40,152
EMPLOYEES
16929
05:40:01,641 --> 05:39:42,888
OVER ISSUES ABOUT
16930
05:40:02,010 --> 05:39:43,355
HOW THE
16931
05:40:02,575 --> 05:39:44,323
AMERICAN WORKPLACE
16932
05:40:03,009 --> 05:39:45,691
WILL BE
16933
05:40:03,409 --> 05:39:46,024
MANAGED.
16934
05:40:04,210 --> 05:39:48,027
BUT IT DOES
16935
05:40:05,845 --> 05:39:48,427
NOT STRIP AWAY THE
16936
05:40:06,213 --> 05:39:49,829
BASIC
16937
05:40:07,881 --> 05:39:50,162
RIGHTS OF WORKERS TO
16938
05:40:08,382 --> 05:39:51,931
CHOOSE TO JOIN
16939
05:40:09,783 --> 05:39:52,465
THE UNION.
16940
05:40:10,350 --> 05:39:53,065
IT DOES NOT ALLOW
16941
05:40:10,984 --> 05:39:53,399
YOU TO
16942
05:40:11,418 --> 05:39:54,934
RETALIATE
16943
05:40:12,919 --> 05:39:55,301
AGAINST THE UNION.
16944
05:40:13,486 --> 05:39:57,103
IT DOES NOT ALLOW
16945
05:40:16,791 --> 05:39:57,470
YOU TO DELAY
16946
05:40:17,324 --> 05:39:57,937
ELECTIONS OR AT
16947
05:40:18,893 --> 05:39:59,105
A POINT WHERE
16948
05:40:19,460 --> 05:39:59,739
YOU BEAT THE UNION
16949
05:40:19,994 --> 05:40:01,074
INTO

05:40:20,461 --> 05:40:01,641

16951
05:40:21,228 --> 05:40:02,010

16952
05:40:21,729 --> 05:40:02,575
DISPIRITED OR
16953
05:40:22,096 --> 05:40:03,009
MOVE AWAY, IT
16954
05:40:23,597 --> 05:40:03,409
DOESN'T ALLOW THAT.
16955
05:40:24,564 --> 05:40:04,210
THAT'S THE BASIC
16956
05:40:25,232 --> 05:40:05,845
LABOR LAW OF
16957
05:40:25,566 --> 05:40:06,213

COUNTRY.
16959
05:40:26,668 --> 05:40:08,382
SO TODAY, THE

05:40:28,302 --> 05:40:09,783
NLRB, WORKING

CONTINUE THE EFFORT
16968
05:40:34,208 --> 05:40:18,893
TO TRY TO
16969
05:40:34,575 --> 05:40:19,460
STRIP
16970
05:40:35,109 --> 05:40:19,994

THEIR RIGHTS.
16972
05:40:37,779 --> 05:40:21,228
THEY CONTINUE THE EFFORT
16973
05:40:38,213 --> 05:40:21,729
IN
16974
05:40:38,947 --> 05:40:22,096
LIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE THAT
16975
05:40:39,614 --> 05:40:23,597
THESE THINGS GET WORKED
16976
05:40:40,181 --> 05:40:24,564
OUT IN
16977
05:40:40,515 --> 05:40:25,232
THE

16981
05:40:42,817 --> 05:40:28,302
THEY'RE
16982
05:40:43,217 --> 05:40:28,803
BIG ISSUES, BUT
16983
05:40:44,953 --> 05:40:29,270
WE HAVE
16984
05:40:45,253 --> 05:40:29,604
A

VEHICLE, THAT'S 75 YEARS OLD,
16986
05:40:47,489 --> 05:40:32,006
THAT
16987
05:40:49,124 --> 05:40:33,274
HAS WORKED WELL ON BEHALF

16989
05:40:50,192 --> 05:40:34,208
ECONOMY.
16990
05:40:50,592 --> 05:40:34,575
NOT ONLY
16991
05:40:52,060 --> 05:40:35,109
DID IT BUILD THE
16992
05:40:52,661 --> 05:40:37,112
MIDDLE CLASS IN THIS
16993
05:40:53,261 --> 05:40:37,779

16994
05:40:53,728 --> 05:40:38,213
IT BUILT ONE
16995
05:40:56,064 --> 05:40:38,947
OF THE LARGEST
16996
05:40:56,766 --> 05:40:39,614
ECONOMIES, BECAUSE WE HAVE

05:41:04,573 --> 05:40:47,489
HOWEVER YOU

17009
05:41:06,542 --> 05:40:49,524

WITH CHINA?
17013
05:41:11,481 --> 05:40:52,661
BECAUSE OUR

NEVERTHELESS,
17791

MR. SPEAKER, THIS
17792
05:52:57,818 --> 05:52:35,561
AMENDMENT IS NOT THE RIGHT
17793
05:52:59,386 --> 05:52:35,861
VEHICLE FOR A NUMBER

17796
05:53:01,255 --> 05:52:39,499
THE

05:53:10,431 --> 05:52:49,109
COMPRESSED FOR

05:53:11,165 --> 05:52:49,776
LITIGANTS,
17808
05:53:11,599 --> 05:52:50,744
ESPECIALLY

05:53:17,105 --> 05:52:57,117
RESPOND.
17815
05:53:17,505 --> 05:52:57,818
WHAT DO
17816
05:53:18,340 --> 05:52:59,386
LITIGANTS AND THEIR

AN

05:53:20,575 --> 05:53:02,756
INADEQUATE AMOUNT
17821
05:53:21,209 --> 05:53:03,390
OF TIME TO

05:53:21,676 --> 05:53:04,825
PREPARE FOR

05:53:22,176 --> 05:53:05,392
LITIGATION?
17824
05:53:22,510 --> 05:53:06,828
THEY
17825
05:53:23,111 --> 05:53:07,195
OVERPLEAD.
17826
05:53:23,444 --> 05:53:08,095
THEY
17827
05:53:24,912 --> 05:53:08,462
OVERANSWER.
17828
05:53:25,546 --> 05:53:09,931
THEY THROW EVERYTHING
17829
05:53:26,950 --> 05:53:10,431
THEY CAN
17830
05:53:27,349 --> 05:53:11,165
INTO THE
17831
05:53:28,383 --> 05:53:11,599
ANSWER BECAUSE TO DO

OTHERWISE IS TO RISK MISSING
17833
05:53:30,018 --> 05:53:12,633
AN
17834
05:53:30,552 --> 05:53:12,967
ISSUE AND BEING
17835
05:53:31,887 --> 05:53:15,903
SUED FOR LEGAL
17836
05:53:32,387 --> 05:53:16,204
MALPRACTICE OR
17837
05:53:33,989 --> 05:53:17,105
WORSE YET FAILING
17838
05:53:34,289 --> 05:53:17,505

05:53:36,192 --> 05:53:18,340
ADEQUATELY REPRESENT YOUR

CLIENT.
17841
05:53:37,259 --> 05:53:19,240
SO,
17842
05:53:39,895 --> 05:53:20,008
IN A VERY COUNTERINTUITIVE
17843
05:53:40,229 --> 05:53:20,575
WAY,
17844
05:53:42,931 --> 05:53:21,209
THE NLRB'S RUSH TO HAVE
17845
05:53:43,398 --> 05:53:21,676
ELECTIONS IS
17846
05:53:45,100 --> 05:53:22,176
MORE LIKELY TO
17847
05:53:45,467 --> 05:53:22,510
RESULT
17848
05:53:48,004 --> 05:53:23,111
IN OVERPLEADING THAN THE

05:53:48,438 --> 05:53:23,444
STATUS QUO
17850
05:53:49,906 --> 05:53:24,912
WOULD BE.
17851
05:53:50,473 --> 05:53:25,546
MR. SPEAKER, THIS
17852
05:53:51,240 --> 05:53:26,950
AMENDMENT ALSO
17853
05:53:51,607 --> 05:53:27,349
GIVES
17854
05:53:53,075 --> 05:53:28,383
INCREASED POWER TO THE
17855
05:53:53,409 --> 05:53:29,117
VERY
17856
05:53:55,144 --> 05:53:30,018
AGENCY THAT WE ARE TRYING
17857
05:53:55,444 --> 05:53:30,552
TO
17858
05:53:57,047 --> 05:53:31,887
REIN IN.
17859
05:53:57,480 --> 05:53:32,387
THAT, TOO,
17860
05:53:59,318 --> 05:53:33,989
IS COUNTERINTUITIVE.
17861

18494
06:03:46,093 --> 06:03:17,164
MR. BOSWELL IS

06:03:47,395 --> 06:03:17,431

DISINCENTIVE WHICH

WORKER, MAYBE
18503
06:03:54,402 --> 06:03:27,441
THERE SHOULD BE A

IT'S A
18510
06:03:58,673 --> 06:03:32,813

CONGRESS.
18513
06:04:00,609 --> 06:03:37,418
VERY NOVEL IDEA.
18514
06:04:01,810 --> 06:03:39,387
THAT THOSE

AMERICAN
18517
06:04:04,913 --> 06:03:42,690
SOCIETY SHOULD HAVE TO
18518
06:04:05,480 --> 06:03:43,057
LIVE BY A SET OF
18519
06:04:06,649 --> 06:03:45,592

THE REST OF AMERICAN

06:04:09,084 --> 06:03:47,862
SOCIETY.
18523
06:04:09,652 --> 06:03:49,431
FOR THAT REASON I
18524
06:04:10,652 --> 06:03:49,897

SIDE OF THE AISLE,
18543
06:04:28,638 --> 06:04:04,913
AND
18544
06:04:29,072 --> 06:04:05,480
AMERICANS

06:04:31,608 --> 06:04:06,649
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
18546
06:04:32,008 --> 06:04:07,049
CAN GET
18547
06:04:37,481 --> 06:04:08,684
PRETTY ANGRY WHEN SOME
18548
06:04:38,015 --> 06:04:09,084

18549
06:04:42,452 --> 06:04:09,652

18551
06:04:45,588 --> 06:04:11,120
EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH
18552
06:04:46,022 --> 06:04:11,487
SALARIES.
18553
06:04:46,557 --> 06:04:13,055
I'M NOT HERE TO

06:04:47,758 --> 06:04:13,789
DEFEND THAT.
18555
06:04:48,092 --> 06:04:15,057
WHAT
18556
06:04:49,727 --> 06:04:16,225
I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE IS
18557
06:04:50,060 --> 06:04:16,993
WHY
18558
06:04:51,562 --> 06:04:17,660
WOULD YOU PUNISH THE
18559
06:04:51,962 --> 06:04:19,061
WORKERS
18560
06:04:56,668 --> 06:04:19,863
BECAUSE THE EMPLOYERS
18561
06:04:57,001 --> 06:04:21,097

18562
06:04:59,604 --> 06:04:21,530
PAYING THEMSELVES TOO MUCH
18563
06:04:59,971 --> 06:04:23,432

18564
06:05:00,738 --> 06:04:23,866
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO
18565
06:05:01,105 --> 06:04:25,968
THAT,
18566
06:05:01,639 --> 06:04:26,903
AND THAT'S
18567
06:05:02,740 --> 06:04:27,270

06:05:03,174 --> 06:04:27,804

18569
06:05:03,607 --> 06:04:28,638
DOES.
18570
06:05:03,908 --> 06:04:29,072
IT
18571
06:05:07,579 --> 06:04:31,608
DENIES WORKERS THE

WE SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHING THOSE

06:05:12,083 --> 06:04:42,853

18655
06:06:32,099 --> 06:06:04,236

EVEN WORSE
18718
06:07:27,157 --> 06:07:04,533
TO FLY HELICOPTERS.
18719
06:07:27,557 --> 06:07:05,467

18723
06:07:30,694 --> 06:07:08,371
BUT THIS
18724
06:07:32,429 --> 06:07:09,171
AMENDMENT IS GOING THE
18725
06:07:32,962 --> 06:07:09,772
WRONG DIRECTION.
18726
06:07:33,596 --> 06:07:10,439
IT'S NOT

06:07:47,311 --> 06:07:15,310

06:07:49,847 --> 06:07:18,214

06:07:54,585 --> 06:07:22,318
THE LEADER
18741
06:07:55,085 --> 06:07:22,785

18743
06:07:56,554 --> 06:07:25,721
WITHOUT

06:07:58,990 --> 06:07:29,926

06:09:44,800 --> 06:09:21,175
DIFFERENCE ABOUT LABOR RIGHTS
18872
06:09:45,367 --> 06:09:21,877

BARGAIN.
18875
06:09:48,471 --> 06:09:23,178
WE ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

AGREE ON THAT
18877
06:09:50,106 --> 06:09:25,613
BUT LET'S FIND
18878
06:09:50,439 --> 06:09:26,013
SOME

AGREE.
18882
06:09:53,409 --> 06:09:28,817
MY AMENDMENT
18883
06:09:53,976 --> 06:09:30,352
IS VERY
18884
06:09:54,510 --> 06:09:30,852
STRAIGHTFORWARD.
18885
06:09:55,177 --> 06:09:31,286
IT SIMPLY
18886
06:09:56,212 --> 06:09:31,786
PREVENTS THIS PIECE
18887
06:09:56,513 --> 06:09:32,120

BEEN CITED -- IT IS VERY
18895
06:10:10,327 --> 06:09:41,263
SIMPLE.
18896
06:10:10,827 --> 06:09:42,731
THESE ARE NOT
18897
06:10:12,262 --> 06:09:43,165
THE VAST MAJORITY
18898
06:10:12,796 --> 06:09:43,599

RULES.
18902
06:10:14,464 --> 06:09:45,934
THIS IS

06:10:16,834 --> 06:09:47,136
THOSE THAT HAVE HAD

SPECIFICALLY AGAINST VETERANS

AND THIS WILL HELP US PROTECT
18908
06:10:21,405 --> 06:09:52,041
THOSE.
18909
06:10:21,705 --> 06:09:52,375
I
18910
06:10:22,106 --> 06:09:52,942

MY AMENDMENT

06:10:43,027 --> 06:10:17,268

06:10:54,139 --> 06:10:28,446
WHO FOUGHT TO PROTECT

06:10:54,473 --> 06:10:29,981
THE

06:10:57,143 --> 06:10:30,314
BASIC AMERICAN RIGHT TO

SAFE WORKPLACE.
18954
06:11:00,246 --> 06:10:34,485
BUT YET WHEN THEY

06:11:01,313 --> 06:10:36,187
COME HOME
18956
06:11:01,780 --> 06:10:36,521
WE'RE GOING

06:11:03,115 --> 06:10:38,023
TO THROW BARRIERS
18958
06:11:03,682 --> 06:10:38,423
IN THE WAY EVEN BY

COMPANIES
18960
06:11:04,750 --> 06:10:40,659

06:11:07,687 --> 06:10:43,027
VETERANS'

06:11:08,588 --> 06:10:43,528
EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS AT

06:11:09,055 --> 06:10:44,295
A TIME WHEN
18965
06:11:10,423 --> 06:10:44,762
WE HAVE HIGH

06:11:10,890 --> 06:10:45,129
UNEMPLOYMENT
18967
06:11:11,457 --> 06:10:46,164
AMONGST VETERANS.
18968
06:11:11,791 --> 06:10:46,765
THIS
18969
06:11:13,159 --> 06:10:47,266
IS ONE WE CAN COME
18970
06:11:13,593 --> 06:10:47,566
TOGETHER.
18971
06:11:13,893 --> 06:10:49,234
BY
18972
06:11:14,093 --> 06:10:49,635
THE
18973
06:11:16,228 --> 06:10:50,202
WAY, TWO MILLION
18974
06:11:16,697 --> 06:10:50,535
VETERANS ARE
18975
06:11:18,165 --> 06:10:52,237
IN LABOR UNIONS OF
18976
06:11:18,632 --> 06:10:52,604
THEIR CHOICE
18977
06:11:19,266 --> 06:10:54,139
NOW.
18978
06:11:19,666 --> 06:10:54,473
SO THIS
18979
06:11:21,301 --> 06:10:57,143
ISN'T A SMALL NUMBER.
18980
06:11:21,835 --> 06:10:57,543
THIS IS A LARGE
18981
06:11:22,335 --> 06:10:59,145
NUMBER.
18982
06:11:22,669 --> 06:10:59,678
WHY
18983
06:11:23,703 --> 06:11:00,246
WOULD CONGRESS HINDER THE
18984
06:11:24,337 --> 06:11:01,313
ABILITY FOR A VETERAN
18985
06:11:25,405 --> 06:11:01,780
TO CHOOSE
18986
06:11:26,005 --> 06:11:03,115
WHETHER OR NOT THEY
18987
06:11:26,407 --> 06:11:03,682
WANT
18988
06:11:26,941 --> 06:11:04,316
REPRESENTATION?
18989
06:11:27,775 --> 06:11:04,750
IT'S WHAT THEY
18990
06:11:29,309 --> 06:11:07,253
FOUGHT FOR.
18991
06:11:29,910 --> 06:11:07,687
WHILE MY COLLEAGUES
18992
06:11:30,477 --> 06:11:08,588
AND I CAN
18993
06:11:30,911 --> 06:11:09,055
DEBATE THE

06:11:33,213 --> 06:11:10,423
ROLE OF GOVERNMENT
18995
06:11:33,714 --> 06:11:10,890
AND COLLECTIVE

BARGAINING, I
18997
06:11:35,115 --> 06:11:11,791
DON'T BELIEVE
18998
06:11:35,549 --> 06:11:13,159
THERE IS A
18999
06:11:36,049 --> 06:11:13,593
DIFFERENCE IN
19000
06:11:36,551 --> 06:11:13,893
WHERE WE BELIEVE
19001
06:11:37,818 --> 06:11:14,093
THIS SHOULD
19002
06:11:40,488 --> 06:11:16,228
NOT APPLY TO
19003
06:11:41,155 --> 06:11:16,697

19582
06:20:46,290 --> 06:20:16,460
WE ALSO RECOGNIZE
19583
06:20:46,625 --> 06:20:17,194
THAT IN THE
19584
06:20:48,093 --> 06:20:18,061
COURSE OF POWER
19585
06:20:49,461 --> 06:20:18,562
THERE IS A
19586
06:20:49,895 --> 06:20:18,963
WORKER AND
19587
06:20:51,396 --> 06:20:21,365

EMPLOYER IN MANY INSTANCES

INTIMIDATES.
19591
06:20:55,433 --> 06:20:25,403
AND SO
19592
06:20:57,503 --> 06:20:25,936
THE NATIONAL LABOR
19593
06:20:58,036 --> 06:20:27,405

19594
06:21:01,573 --> 06:20:27,938

UNEVENNESS OF POWER
19596
06:21:03,608 --> 06:20:30,875

OR VETERANS, WHETHER OR
19600
06:21:07,647 --> 06:20:33,177
NOT THEY'RE SINGLE
19601
06:21:09,648 --> 06:20:33,410
MOTHERS,
19602
06:21:10,349 --> 06:20:34,645
WORKING FAMILIES WHO WANT

BETTER THEIR

06:21:12,685 --> 06:20:36,781
LIFE, THEY
19606
06:21:13,319 --> 06:20:38,516
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE
19607
06:21:13,886 --> 06:20:38,916
NEEDS TO
19608
06:21:14,186 --> 06:20:41,552
BE
19609
06:21:16,689 --> 06:20:41,986
A FAIRNESS IN ORDER FOR THIS
19610
06:21:17,324 --> 06:20:43,654
LITTLE SMALL BOOK, THE
19611
06:21:18,258 --> 06:20:44,088

OPERATE.
19614
06:21:20,193 --> 06:20:46,625
SO MY AMENDMENT IS
19615
06:21:22,628 --> 06:20:48,093
VERY SIMPLE.
19616
06:21:23,095 --> 06:20:49,461
MY AMENDMENT
19617
06:21:24,797 --> 06:20:49,895
ATTEMPTS TO MAKE AN
19618
06:21:25,131 --> 06:20:51,396
EVEN
19619
06:21:28,668 --> 06:20:51,765
PLAYING FIELD AND IT TAKES
19620
06:21:29,302 --> 06:20:54,566
AWAY THE POWER OF THE

06:21:30,904 --> 06:20:54,566
UNDERLYING
19622
06:21:31,371 --> 06:20:55,033
LEGISLATION
19623
06:21:33,673 --> 06:20:55,433
WHICH IS TO LIMIT
19624
06:21:34,073 --> 06:20:57,503
HOW LONG
19625
06:21:37,778 --> 06:20:58,036
THE ELECTION MAY GO ON
19626
06:21:38,245 --> 06:21:01,573
AND IN FACT
19627
06:21:40,247 --> 06:21:02,174
DELAY THE ELECTION,
19628
06:21:40,547 --> 06:21:03,608
IF
19629
06:21:40,814 --> 06:21:04,409

06:21:41,915 --> 06:21:04,943
WILL.
19631
06:21:42,249 --> 06:21:07,046
AND
19632
06:21:43,850 --> 06:21:07,647
SO THIS AMENDMENT STRIKES
19633
06:21:44,351 --> 06:21:09,648
THE PROVISION
19634
06:21:45,986 --> 06:21:10,349

19638
06:21:49,957 --> 06:21:13,319
CAN GO ON AND
19639
06:21:50,291 --> 06:21:13,886
THE
19640
06:21:52,860 --> 06:21:14,186
EMPLOYER CAN INTERFERE WITH
19641
06:21:53,360 --> 06:21:16,689
THAT ELECTION.
19642
06:21:54,295 --> 06:21:17,324
DELAY GIVES

TIME FRAME TO

06:22:02,937 --> 06:21:22,628
DELAY THE
19648
06:22:03,371 --> 06:21:23,095
ELECTIONS.
19649
06:22:04,005 --> 06:21:24,797
IT'S A SIMPLE PREMISE
19650
06:22:05,806 --> 06:21:25,131
THAT YOU
19651
06:22:06,175 --> 06:21:28,668
WIN OR
19652
06:22:08,977 --> 06:21:29,302
LOSE ELECTIONS, BUT IF
19653
06:22:09,678 --> 06:21:30,904
YOU ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO USE
19654
06:22:10,045 --> 06:21:31,371
THE
19655
06:22:10,378 --> 06:21:33,673
HAND
19656
06:22:13,014 --> 06:21:34,073
OF INTIMIDATION AND TO STOP
19657
06:22:13,348 --> 06:21:37,778
THE
19658
06:22:15,116 --> 06:21:38,245
ELECTION, YOU TAKE AWAY SOME
19659
06:22:15,483 --> 06:21:40,247

06:22:17,019 --> 06:21:40,547
PRIVILEGES OF BEING AN

AMERICAN.
19662
06:22:18,687 --> 06:21:41,915
NOW, I FRANKLY BELIEVE
19663
06:22:19,188 --> 06:21:42,249
THAT IN
19664
06:22:19,621 --> 06:21:43,850
THIS TIME
19665
06:22:21,090 --> 06:21:44,351
THAT WE'RE ON THE

19672
06:22:25,861 --> 06:21:52,860
I BELIEVE THAT WE

06:22:26,161 --> 06:21:53,360
SHOULD BE
19674
06:22:27,797 --> 06:21:54,295

NOT DOING THAT.
19680
06:22:31,467 --> 06:22:03,371
WE'RE HERE
19681
06:22:33,169 --> 06:22:04,005
TO LIMIT THE RIGHTS

06:22:35,170 --> 06:22:06,175

06:39:40,607 --> 06:39:01,599
NOT PROTECTING THE RIGHTS

THE

06:39:52,686 --> 06:39:13,679

20716
06:39:59,994 --> 06:39:19,652
SO THIS
20717
06:40:01,829 --> 06:39:20,786
IS AN EFFORT TO KILL
20718
06:40:02,263 --> 06:39:22,488
THE BILL.
20719
06:40:02,897 --> 06:39:22,888
I BELIEVE IT'S A GOOD
20720
06:40:03,731 --> 06:39:24,423
BILL.
20721
06:40:04,198 --> 06:39:24,790
IT RESTORES
20722
06:40:04,999 --> 06:39:27,293

06:40:05,332 --> 06:39:27,694

SURELY
21294
07:35:47,551 --> 07:34:48,556
NO ONE IN THIS CHAMBER
21295
07:35:47,885 --> 07:34:50,057
CAN
21296
07:35:50,554 --> 07:34:50,725
DISAGREE THAT IN THESE HARD
21297
07:35:50,921 --> 07:34:51,725
TIMES
21298
07:35:53,456 --> 07:34:59,334
WORKING FAMILIES IN THIS

07:35:56,493 --> 07:35:00,768
A FAIR SHAKE.

FUNDAMENTALLY
21306
07:36:02,733 --> 07:35:07,008
UNFAIR.

07:36:03,200 --> 07:35:07,444

07:36:19,284 --> 07:35:23,859
UNFAIR

07:36:49,716 --> 07:35:45,615
REJECTED THE

UNION-BUSTING EFFORT
21342
07:36:51,717 --> 07:35:47,551
THAT WOULD

21345
07:36:55,454 --> 07:35:50,921
AGAINST THEM.
21346
07:36:56,322 --> 07:35:53,456
AT A TIME WHEN
21347
07:36:57,958 --> 07:35:53,990
PUBLIC OFFICIALS
21348
07:36:58,592 --> 07:35:56,493
ACROSS EVERY LEVEL OF
21349
07:36:59,192 --> 07:35:57,061
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE
21350
07:37:00,160 --> 07:35:58,462
FOCUSED ON
21351
07:37:00,727 --> 07:35:58,863
GETTING AMERICANS
21352
07:37:01,094 --> 07:36:00,498
BACK TO WORK,
21353
07:37:02,495 --> 07:36:00,998
THE UNDERLYING
21354
07:37:04,964 --> 07:36:02,733
BILL BEFORE US
21355
07:37:05,531 --> 07:36:03,200
TODAY, LIKE OHIO'S
21356
07:37:06,934 --> 07:36:04,635
RECENTLY
21357
07:37:07,334 --> 07:36:04,935
REPEALED
21358
07:37:09,069 --> 07:36:07,705
SENATE BILL 5, WOULD
21359
07:37:09,570 --> 07:36:08,006
UNFAIRLY STACK

07:37:11,138 --> 07:36:11,542
THE DECK AGAINST

07:37:11,471 --> 07:36:11,942
OUR
21362
07:37:13,976 --> 07:36:14,545
WORKERS AND AMERICAN JOBS.
21363
07:37:14,441 --> 07:36:14,879
BUT THE GOOD
21364
07:37:16,042 --> 07:36:17,115
NEWS, MR. SPEAKER,
21365
07:37:16,476 --> 07:36:17,582
IS THAT IT
21366
07:37:18,112 --> 07:36:18,917
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
21367
07:37:18,446 --> 07:36:19,284
THAT
21368
07:37:20,214 --> 07:36:21,619
WAY.
21369
07:37:20,581 --> 07:36:22,020
RIGHT
21370
07:37:23,083 --> 07:36:22,954
HERE RIGHT NOW WE,
21371
07:37:23,584 --> 07:36:25,657
DEMOCRATS AND
21372
07:37:24,385 --> 07:36:26,124
REPUBLICANS
21373
07:37:24,818 --> 07:36:29,828
TOGETHER,
21374
07:37:25,252 --> 07:36:30,595
LIKE SO MANY
21375
07:37:27,122 --> 07:36:31,296
VOTERS
21376
07:37:27,589 --> 07:36:36,468
IN OHIO JOIN
21377
07:37:29,190 --> 07:36:36,668
TOGETHER, WE CAN
21378
07:37:29,824 --> 07:36:38,304
STAND UP FOR FAIRNESS
21379
07:37:31,159 --> 07:36:39,038
AND THE
21380
07:37:31,626 --> 07:36:40,272
MIDDLE CLASS
21381
07:37:34,295 --> 07:36:42,675
AND PASS THIS
21382
07:37:34,729 --> 07:36:43,177
AMENDMENT.
21383
07:37:35,529 --> 07:36:44,009
OUR AMENDMENT WOULD IMPROVE THE
21384
07:37:35,863 --> 07:36:44,476
BILL
21385
07:37:36,597 --> 07:36:44,743
IN THREE VERY IMPORTANT
21386
07:37:37,766 --> 07:36:46,678
WAYS.
21387
07:37:38,467 --> 07:36:47,113
FIRST, IT WOULD LEVEL THE
21388
07:37:39,734 --> 07:36:49,716
PLAYING FIELD
21389
07:37:41,369 --> 07:36:50,316
BETWEEN EMPLOYEES
21390
07:37:41,870 --> 07:36:51,717
AND CORPORATE
21391
07:37:42,370 --> 07:36:52,218
BOARDS.
21392
07:37:42,704 --> 07:36:54,954
IT'S
21393
07:37:45,406 --> 07:36:55,454
ONLY FAIR WHEN WORKERS
21394
07:37:45,773 --> 07:36:56,322
CHOOSE
21395
07:37:47,209 --> 07:36:57,958
WHETHER TO ORGANIZE A
21396
07:37:47,710 --> 07:36:58,592
UNION, THEY'RE
21397
07:37:48,444 --> 07:36:59,192
CHOOSING WHO
21398
07:37:48,811 --> 07:37:00,160
THEIR
21399
07:37:49,711 --> 07:37:00,727
REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE IN
21400
07:37:50,045 --> 07:37:01,094
THE
21401
07:37:50,446 --> 07:37:02,495
WORKPLACE.
21402
07:37:50,782 --> 07:37:04,964
WHEN
21403
07:37:52,281 --> 07:37:05,531
A BOARD OF DIRECTORS TAKES
21404
07:37:52,714 --> 07:37:06,934
A VOTE ON
21405
07:37:54,182 --> 07:37:07,334
WHETHER TO HIRE A
21406
07:37:54,583 --> 07:37:09,069
C.E.O.,
21407
07:37:56,351 --> 07:37:09,570
THEY'RE CHOOSING
21408
07:37:56,819 --> 07:37:11,138
MANAGEMENT'S
21409
07:37:57,553 --> 07:37:11,471
REPRESENTATIVE IN
21410
07:37:57,887 --> 07:37:13,976
THE
21411
07:37:58,421 --> 07:37:14,441
WORKPLACE.
21412
07:37:58,888 --> 07:37:16,042
AND I DOUBT
21413
07:37:59,588 --> 07:37:16,476
THAT PROPONENTS OF
21414
07:37:59,922 --> 07:37:18,112
THIS
21415
07:38:01,557 --> 07:37:18,446
BILL WOULD EVER THINK OF
21416
07:38:01,957 --> 07:37:20,214
LEAVING
21417
07:38:03,425 --> 07:37:20,581
A CORPORATION VOICELESS
21418
07:38:03,726 --> 07:37:23,083
OR
21419
07:38:05,461 --> 07:37:23,584
FLOW OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF
21420
07:38:05,928 --> 07:37:24,385
A CORPORATE
21421
07:38:08,331 --> 07:37:24,818
BOARD OF DIRECTOR'S
21422
07:38:08,998 --> 07:37:25,252
ABILITY TO CHOOSE THEIR
21423
07:38:09,499 --> 07:37:27,122
NEXT
21424
07:38:10,133 --> 07:37:27,589
C.E.O. AND YET THAT'S
21425
07:38:10,500 --> 07:37:29,190
EXACTLY
21426
07:38:10,934 --> 07:37:29,824
WHAT THIS
21427
07:38:12,435 --> 07:37:31,159
BILL BEFORE US DOES
21428
07:38:12,902 --> 07:37:31,626
TO WORKERS.
21429
07:38:13,836 --> 07:37:34,295
IT'S NOT
21430
07:38:14,573 --> 07:37:34,729
RIGHT.
21431
07:38:14,971 --> 07:37:35,529
WORKERS
21432
07:38:15,905 --> 07:37:35,863
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT
21433
07:38:16,239 --> 07:37:36,597
ANY
21434
07:38:16,606 --> 07:37:37,766
LONGER THAN A
21435
07:38:17,674 --> 07:37:38,467
CORPORATE
21436
07:38:18,075 --> 07:37:39,734
BOARD OF
21437
07:38:18,642 --> 07:37:41,369
DIRECTORS.
21438
07:38:18,975 --> 07:37:41,870
AND
21439
07:38:20,510 --> 07:37:42,370
SO THIS AMENDMENT LEVELS
21440
07:38:21,211 --> 07:37:42,704
THINGS OUT BY SAYING THAT
21441
07:38:21,912 --> 07:37:45,406
NOTHING
21442
07:38:23,480 --> 07:37:45,773
IN THIS BILL WILL
21443
07:38:23,913 --> 07:37:47,209
IMPOSE ANY
21444
07:38:24,814 --> 07:37:47,710
LONGER WAITING

07:38:25,181 --> 07:37:48,444
PERIOD
21446
07:38:27,518 --> 07:37:48,811
FOR WORKERS TO VOTE FOR
21447
07:38:27,918 --> 07:37:49,711
A UNION
21448
07:38:29,620 --> 07:37:50,045
THAN ANY STATE LAW
21449
07:38:30,187 --> 07:37:50,446
IMPOSES ON A BOARD
21450
07:38:30,855 --> 07:37:50,782
OF DIRECTORS
21451
07:38:31,222 --> 07:37:52,281
VOTING
21452
07:38:32,656 --> 07:37:52,714
ON A C.E.O.
21453
07:38:33,290 --> 07:37:54,182
SECOND, THIS AMENDMENT
21454
07:38:34,658 --> 07:37:54,583
WILL
21455
07:38:35,325 --> 07:37:56,351
MAKE SURE THAT ELECTIONS
21456
07:38:36,059 --> 07:37:56,819
PROCEED
21457
07:38:39,763 --> 07:37:57,553
LEGITIMATELY AND
21458
07:38:40,163 --> 07:37:57,887
FAIRLY.
21459
07:38:40,964 --> 07:37:58,421
EVERYONE CAN AGREE THAT WORKERS
21460
07:38:42,365 --> 07:37:58,888
DESERVE TO BE FULLY
21461
07:38:42,966 --> 07:37:59,588
INFORMED.
21462
07:38:43,533 --> 07:37:59,922
SO THIS AMENDMENT
21463
07:38:44,000 --> 07:38:01,557
REQUIRES THAT
21464
07:38:44,334 --> 07:38:01,957
WHEN
21465
07:38:44,901 --> 07:38:03,425

21473
07:38:53,143 --> 07:38:10,500
UNDER

07:38:55,679 --> 07:38:10,934
CURRENT LAW, MR. SPEAKER,

08:39:12,350 --> 08:38:17,160
WE CAN GO OUT AND

08:39:12,917 --> 08:38:17,860
CREATE MORE JOBS.
23007
08:39:14,552 --> 08:38:18,461

08:52:33,987 --> 08:51:24,647
PULLED
23786
08:52:35,121 --> 08:51:25,148

23787
08:52:35,755 --> 08:51:27,751

23788
08:52:37,291 --> 08:51:28,052
MR.
23789
08:52:40,927 --> 08:51:29,720
KIVITZ' COMPANY HAD 160

EMPLOYEES IN 2005.
23791

23793
08:52:48,202 --> 08:51:34,191
FROM
23794
08:52:52,907 --> 08:51:36,660
160 TO 52.
23795
08:52:53,273 --> 08:51:37,127
THEIR
23796
08:52:55,175 --> 08:51:39,697
VOLUME OF BUSINESS IS
23797
08:52:55,509 --> 08:51:40,364
DOWN
23798
08:52:56,944 --> 08:51:40,831
60%.
23799
08:52:57,445 --> 08:51:41,198
THEIR BUSINESS
23800
08:52:58,980 --> 08:51:42,967
HAS NOT MADE A
23801
08:52:59,547 --> 08:51:43,367
PROFIT IN THE LAST
23802
08:53:02,950 --> 08:51:47,037
THREE YEARS.
23803
08:53:03,551 --> 08:51:49,707
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.
23804
08:53:05,352 --> 08:51:50,208
THEY HAVE
23805
08:53:06,954 --> 08:51:51,709
NOT INCREASED THE

08:53:07,389 --> 08:51:52,110

08:53:10,025 --> 08:51:53,745
THEIR PRODUCTS,
23808
08:53:10,625 --> 08:51:54,345
EITHER, SINCE 2005.
23809
08:53:14,696 --> 08:51:56,014
THIS HAS BEEN DUE
23810
08:53:15,296 --> 08:51:56,647
TO THE FEAR
23811
08:53:15,597 --> 08:51:57,449
OF
23812
08:53:18,367 --> 08:51:57,716
LOSING MORE BUSINESS, EVEN

08:53:18,834 --> 08:51:59,318

TRIED TO MAINTAIN
23821
08:53:24,639 --> 08:52:06,291
THEIR BUSINESS
23822
08:53:26,241 --> 08:52:07,893

08:53:29,111 --> 08:52:09,094
SAME LEVEL.
23825

AT ONE

COMPLETELY OUT OF THE

REALM OF POSSIBILITY.
23857

08:54:12,022 --> 08:53:10,025

08:54:22,667 --> 08:53:21,103
A TIME
23877
08:54:24,435 --> 08:53:22,337
WHEN WE ARE STRUGGLING
23878
08:54:24,902 --> 08:53:22,838

08:54:26,437 --> 08:53:23,338
MOST BASIC COSTS OF

RUNNING OUR BUSINESS.
23881
08:54:28,573 --> 08:53:26,241

THESE THINGS

09:14:14,608 --> 09:13:23,856
FOR ME TO

SAY OF THOSE WORDS.
24984
09:14:16,576 --> 09:13:26,158
WE
24985
09:14:19,614 --> 09:13:26,492
MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION
24986
09:14:20,114 --> 09:13:27,159
DRAMATICALLY.
24987
09:14:20,614 --> 09:13:27,527
THE
24988
09:14:21,383 --> 09:13:27,826
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

09:14:23,318 --> 09:13:30,063
THINGS THAT I DESCRIBED

09:14:25,786 --> 09:13:32,031
GOOD.
24995
09:14:26,154 --> 09:13:33,966
HE HAS

09:14:36,631 --> 09:13:40,607

U.S. TREASURY BILLS
25005
09:14:39,267 --> 09:13:42,574

SAFEST PLACE TO PUT YOUR

09:14:47,176 --> 09:13:46,178
GOTTEN UNSTABLE.

THE EURO
25013
09:14:50,814 --> 09:13:46,980

25014
09:14:51,214 --> 09:13:48,682
SAY AN

09:14:52,815 --> 09:13:49,083
UNBALANCED CONDITION
25016
09:14:53,182 --> 09:13:50,784
RIGHT
25017
09:14:53,750 --> 09:13:51,285
NOW.
25018
09:14:54,284 --> 09:13:52,985
THEY HAVE SPENT
25019
09:14:55,985 --> 09:13:53,620
MONEY IN THE

HAVE.
25026
09:15:02,591 --> 09:13:58,625
THEY HAVE
25027
09:15:04,627 --> 09:13:59,794
BUILT A GOVERNMENT
25028
09:15:05,161 --> 09:14:00,697
BUREAUCRACY MUCH
25029
09:15:06,763 --> 09:14:01,161
HEAVIER, I HAVE
25030
09:15:07,263 --> 09:14:01,529
TWICE BEEN TO

HEADS IN THE SAND
25034
09:15:10,900 --> 09:14:07,802
IN MY
25035
09:15:11,769 --> 09:14:08,169
OPINION.
25036
09:15:12,336 --> 09:14:08,536
THEY BELIEVE THAT
25037
09:15:12,703 --> 09:14:09,070
THEY ARE
25038
09:15:13,404 --> 09:14:11,572
THE
25039
09:15:13,803 --> 09:14:11,940
FIRST OF
25040
09:15:18,176 --> 09:14:14,175
A MULTIPLE DOMINOES AND

G.D.P. OF THE EUROPEAN

25045
09:15:24,749 --> 09:14:20,114
AND
25046
09:15:25,148 --> 09:14:20,614
IF THEY
25047
09:15:25,483 --> 09:14:21,383
ARE NOT
25048
09:15:26,983 --> 09:14:22,017
BAILED OUT BY

09:15:27,318 --> 09:14:22,317
THE

E.U.
25051
09:15:29,987 --> 09:14:23,985
AND THAT MEANS -- YES,
25052
09:15:30,321 --> 09:14:24,419
LOAN
25053
09:15:32,957 --> 09:14:25,786

FORGIVENESS AND IF THEY
25056
09:15:37,796 --> 09:14:32,059
DEFAULT,
25057
09:15:39,398 --> 09:14:32,394
THEN THEY WILL MOVE
25058
09:15:39,898 --> 09:14:33,362
AWAY FROM THE
25059
09:15:42,133 --> 09:14:33,695
EURO, THE CURRENCY
25060
09:15:42,466 --> 09:14:35,998
AND
25061
09:15:45,403 --> 09:14:36,398
PRINT THEIR MONEY BACK IN
25062
09:15:45,803 --> 09:14:36,631
GREECE A
25063
09:15:46,071 --> 09:14:38,868
SECOND

TIME OR AGAIN.
25065
09:15:47,839 --> 09:14:42,171
AND IF THAT
25066
09:15:50,009 --> 09:14:42,538
HAPPENS, THEY THINK
25067
09:15:50,409 --> 09:14:42,872
THE EURO
25068
09:15:50,775 --> 09:14:44,607
BECOMES LESS
25069
09:15:51,610 --> 09:14:45,074
STABLE AND
25070
09:15:51,977 --> 09:14:47,176
IF THE

GREEKS AREN'T INVOLVED IN
25072
09:15:54,313 --> 09:14:50,814
IT
25073
09:15:57,182 --> 09:14:51,214
SOMEHOW AND IF THEY AREN'T
25074
09:15:57,583 --> 09:14:52,815
HELD UP,
25075
09:16:00,386 --> 09:14:53,182
PROPPED UP, THEY WILL
25076
09:16:00,752 --> 09:14:53,750
FOLLOW
25077
09:16:03,589 --> 09:14:54,284
THE DOMINOE AND THEIR

09:16:04,156 --> 09:14:55,985
DOMINOE WILL CLIP

09:16:07,661 --> 09:14:58,388
PORTUGAL,

09:16:10,196 --> 09:14:58,790
BELGIUM, SPAIN, NAME

09:16:10,530 --> 09:15:01,391
YOUR

25084
09:16:12,197 --> 09:15:02,159
IT MAY OR
25085
09:16:13,966 --> 09:15:02,591
MAY NOT BE TRUE.
25086
09:16:14,434 --> 09:15:04,627
IT'S HARD TO
25087
09:16:15,802 --> 09:15:05,161
LOOK AT GREECE AND
25088
09:16:16,302 --> 09:15:06,763
ARGUE IF THEY
25089
09:16:17,972 --> 09:15:07,263
ARE A DOMINOE AND
25090
09:16:18,372 --> 09:15:08,799
IF THEY
25091
09:16:20,273 --> 09:15:09,300
FALL, THEY WILL HIT ONE
25092
09:16:20,574 --> 09:15:10,534
OF
25093
09:16:23,576 --> 09:15:10,900
THOSE UNSTABLE COUNTRIES AND
25094
09:16:24,011 --> 09:15:11,769
WILL START
25095
09:16:25,779 --> 09:15:12,336
THIS CASCADING EFFECT
25096
09:16:26,446 --> 09:15:12,703
THROUGH THEDOM KNOWS OF
25097
09:16:27,915 --> 09:15:13,404
THOSE
25098
09:16:28,316 --> 09:15:13,803
UNSTABLE
25099
09:16:30,384 --> 09:15:18,176
COUNTRIES.
25100
09:16:30,818 --> 09:15:18,608
MIGHT NOT
25101
09:16:34,053 --> 09:15:23,014
BE TRUE.
25102
09:16:34,355 --> 09:15:23,648
.
25103
09:16:38,159 --> 09:15:24,048
COULD BE
25104
09:16:39,860 --> 09:15:24,749
THEY HAVE A FIREWALL
25105
09:16:40,294 --> 09:15:25,148
BUILT ARN
25106
09:16:41,862 --> 09:15:25,483
IT AND IF THEY FALL,
25107
09:16:42,362 --> 09:15:26,983
THEY FALL AND
25108
09:16:43,064 --> 09:15:27,318
THEY HAVE TO
25109
09:16:43,430 --> 09:15:27,619
BUILD
25110
09:16:44,866 --> 09:15:29,987
THEIR COUNTRY BACK UP
25111
09:16:45,233 --> 09:15:30,321
AGAIN.
25112
09:16:46,000 --> 09:15:32,957
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN
25113
09:16:47,335 --> 09:15:33,358
GREECE.
25114
09:16:47,936 --> 09:15:37,396
I HOPE THAT THERE'S
25115
09:16:49,036 --> 09:15:37,796
A STABLE
25116
09:16:49,737 --> 09:15:39,398
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT
25117
09:16:50,939 --> 09:15:39,898
GROWS
25118
09:16:51,439 --> 09:15:42,133
OUT OF EUROPE.
25119
09:16:52,239 --> 09:15:42,466
WE'RE TIED TO

09:16:53,775 --> 09:15:45,403
THEM FINANCIALLY
25121
09:16:54,309 --> 09:15:45,803
WITH HUNDREDS OF

09:16:55,042 --> 09:15:46,071
BILLIONS OF

IF
25128
09:16:59,848 --> 09:15:51,610
THEY SHOULD FAIL IT HURTS US
25129
09:17:00,214 --> 09:15:51,977
BADLY.
25130
09:17:00,582 --> 09:15:54,013
WE'RE
25131
09:17:00,816 --> 09:15:54,313
ALSO

09:17:02,250 --> 09:15:57,182
HIGHLY LEVERAGED IN

09:17:02,584 --> 09:15:57,583
THIS
25134
09:17:03,017 --> 09:16:00,386

THE FIRST THING WE

TACTIC.
25331
09:20:16,653 --> 09:19:15,589
YES, THE TACTIC HAD BEEN USED
25332
09:20:17,320 --> 09:19:15,956

USED BEFORE.
25336
09:20:19,357 --> 09:19:21,129
SO
25337
09:20:20,758 --> 09:19:21,596
THAT'S IN THERE.
25338
09:20:21,225 --> 09:19:21,930

25456
09:22:03,632 --> 09:21:14,480
HAD HE DOPE

OF
25465
09:22:10,206 --> 09:21:21,555
LEGISLATION, OBAMACARE,
25466
09:22:10,573 --> 09:21:24,057
MEANS

25471
09:22:16,478 --> 09:21:26,760
THAT WOULD HAVE

25474
09:22:19,248 --> 09:21:28,996

SHOWDOWN AND
25479
09:22:23,685 --> 09:21:35,803
I THINK
25480
09:22:24,452 --> 09:21:36,236
THE PRESIDENT WOULD

09:22:25,086 --> 09:21:37,137

25499
09:22:41,704 --> 09:21:52,120
THE C.R. WAS
25500
09:22:43,973 --> 09:21:52,754

09:24:46,100 --> 09:23:50,376
WAS THE

09:24:47,669 --> 09:23:50,943
THREAT THAT IF THE

A

09:24:51,473 --> 09:23:55,014

09:24:55,343 --> 09:23:59,218
THE SE QUEST RAGE, I DON'T KNOW
25634
09:24:56,144 --> 09:23:59,752
WHERE THE LANGUAGE
25635
09:24:57,513 --> 09:24:01,254
OF THAT CAME
25636
09:24:57,947 --> 09:24:01,688
FROM, BUT
25637
09:24:59,581 --> 09:24:04,257
THE SEQUESTRATION IS

DEAL WAS PUT
25645
09:25:04,886 --> 09:24:11,231
ON PAPER THAT WE
25646
09:25:05,220 --> 09:24:11,665
HAD
25647
09:25:06,655 --> 09:24:13,233
TO GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF
25648
09:25:07,055 --> 09:24:13,700
THINGS.
25649
09:25:07,389 --> 09:24:14,601
ONE
25650
09:25:07,924 --> 09:24:14,968
WAS WE HAD TO HAVE

09:25:08,824 --> 09:24:17,370
A DEBATE

09:25:09,392 --> 09:24:17,971

WE HAD
25658
09:25:13,929 --> 09:24:24,178
THAT DEBATE.
25659
09:25:14,330 --> 09:24:24,778
I THINK
25660
09:25:15,864 --> 09:24:27,347
I WON THE DEBATE AND
25661
09:25:16,265 --> 09:24:27,715
LOST THE

25670
09:25:23,806 --> 09:24:36,423
DIDN'T CALL IT A CLEAN

09:25:24,207 --> 09:24:36,990
VERSION.
25672
09:25:24,974 --> 09:24:38,326

WE
25678
09:25:30,947 --> 09:24:42,930
SHOULD HAVE LET THE

A GOOD CONSTITUTIONAL

09:25:50,635 --> 09:25:01,650
AMENDMENT THAT WE COULD LIVE

09:25:51,469 --> 09:25:02,117
WITH THAT WOULD
25702
09:25:52,303 --> 09:25:03,685
STRENGTHEN THIS
